Our only exception has been when those on the outside can make our lifeboat stronger and more self-sustaining.","127": "Everyone is guilty of something, and everyone still harbors a memory of childhood innocence, no matter how many layers of life wrap around it. Humanity is innocent; humanity is guilty, and both states are undeniably true.","128": "People, I have discovered, are layers and layers of secrets. You believe you know them, that you understand them, but their motives are always hidden from you, buried in their own hearts. You will never know them, but sometimes you decide to trust them.","129": "After graduating from our school, they went into the Woods expecting epic battles with monsters and wizards, only to find their fairy tales unfold right in their own houses. They didn't realize that villains are the ones closest to us. They didn't realize that to find a happy ending, a hero must first look right under his nose.","130": "It's a queer thing, growing up. The years pile up, Hap, but at the same time I'm still ever age I ever was. When we stood before those sea-giants, I felt five years old, awed and scared. When I see a pretty lady, I'm eighteen again! And when my bones remind me, I feel all of my sixty years. All those ages are still inside me, all at once. The years stack up like sediment, and the layers remain.","131": "You're used to being underestimated, so you want to prove yourself. Don't let that be your crutch. Accept help when you need it.","132": "Making mistakes is part of learning to choose well. No way around it. Choices are thrust upon us, and we don't always get things right. Even postponing or avoiding a decision can become a choice that carries heavy consequences. Mistakes can be painful-sometimes they cause irrevocable harm-but welcome to Earth. Poor choices are part of growing up, and part of life. You will make bad choices, and you will be affected by the poor choices of others. We must rise above such things.","133": "Knowledge always has the potential to be dangerous. It is a more powerful weapon than any sword or spell.","134": "Love and madness are two stars in the same sky. You cannot build a roof to keep out last year's rain.","135": "The world isn't fair?

There should always be lots of pockets... the more pockets, the better!","137": "I walked up to Griz and poked him in the chest. \"Let me make this perfectly clear to you. Though some might seek to make it appear otherwise, I am not a bride to be bartered away to another kingdom, not a prize of war, not a mouthpiece for your Komizar. I am not a chip in a card game to be mindlessly tossed into the center of the pot, nor one to be kept in the tight fist of a greedy opponent. I am a player seated at the table alongside everyone else, and from this day forward, I will play my own hand as I see fit. Do you understand me? Because the consequences could be ugly if someone thought otherwise.\"","138": "In fact, I've essentially given up on the idea of flight altogether and accepted that I'm going to be an angel-blood who stays earthbound, a flightless bird, like an ostrich. Maybe, or in this weather, a penguin.","139": "You don't cry when someone pushes you down. You get up. You get up and you fight back. And pretty soon nobody's going to shove you anymore because they'll see it's not worth it.","140": "I've spent a lifetime practicing, becoming who I must be to survive. Hiding in plain sight, always acting, always playing a part. There are times when I fear that I'll lose me, my true self, in the haze of the facade. But that fear doesn't matter to anyone besides myself.","141": "A week ago you said to me, \"Do you believe I'll never be too far.\" If you're lost, just look for me, you'll find me in the region of the summer stars. The fact that we can sit right here and say goodbye means we've already won. A necessity for apologies between you and me, baby, there is none.","142": "Don't you know I'm still standing better than I ever did. Looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid. I'm still standing after all this time. Picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind.","143": "All my life, you stood by me, when no one else was ever behind me. All these lights, they can't blind me. With your love, nobody can drag me down.","144": "At some point in your childhood you and your friends went outside to play together for the last time and nobody knew.","145": "What is the cause of historical events? Power. What is power? Power is the sum total of wills transferred to one person. On what condition are the wills of the masses transferred to one person? On condition that the person express the will of the whole people. That is, power is power. That is, power is a word the meaning of which we do not understand.","146": "At moments of departure and a change of life, people capable of reflecting on their actions usually get into a serious state of mind. At these moments they usually take stock of the past and make plans for the future.","147": "I don't pretend to be wise, but I am observing, and I see a great deal more than you'd imagine. I'm interested in other people's experiences and inconsistencies, and, though I can't explain, I remember and use them for my own benefit.","148": "You have a good many little gifts and virtues, but there is no need of parading them, for conceit spoils the finest genius. There is not much danger that real talent or goodness will be overlooked long; even if it is, the consciousness of possessing and using it well should satisfy one, and the great charm of all power is modesty.","149": "Some things you just can't explain. You don't even try. You don't know where to start. All your sentences would jumble up like a giant knot if you opened your mouth. Any words you used would come out wrong.","150": "There's a word like overprotective to describe some parents, but no word that means the opposite. What word do you use to describe parents who don't protect enough? Underprotective? Neglectful? Self-involved? Lame? All of the above.","151": "Stories are for joining the past to the future. Stories are for those late hours in the night when you can't remember how you got from where you were to where you are. Stories are for eternity, when memory is erased, when there is nothing to remember except the story.","152": "Life is like a tray of fruits. Some fruits are sour, others are sweet. Some fruits are ripe, and other fruits are rotten. Never expect the best out of what you get.","153": "It's been a hard day's night, and I've been working like a dog. It's been a hard day's night, I should be sleeping like a log. But when I get home to you I'll find the things that you do, will make me feel alright.","154": "Fear was always a part of life for the people. Because of fear, they made shelter and found food and grew things. For the same reason, weapons were stored, waiting. There was fear of cold, of sickness and hunger. There was fear of beasts.","155": "He saw Forest and understood what Seer had meant. It was an illusion. It was a tangled knot of fears and deceits and dark struggles for power that had disguised itself and almost destroyed everything. Now it was unfolding, like a flower coming into bloom, radiant with possibility.","156": "It bothered him a little to lie about small things. But he always had; he had grown up lying, and he still found it strange that the people in this place where he now lived thought lying was wrong. To Matty, it was sometimes a way of making things easier, more comfortable, more convenient.","157": "I was looking for myself and asking everyone except myself questions which I, and only I, could answer. It took me a long time and much painful boomeranging of my expectations to achieve a realization everyone else appears to have been born with: That I am nobody but myself.","158": "Perhaps simple to be known, to be looked upon by so many people, to be the focal point of so many concentrating eyes, perhaps this was enough to make one different; enough to transform one into something else, someone else; just as by becoming an increasingly larger boy one became one day a man.","159": "And I defend because in spite of all I find that I love. In order to get some of it down I have to love. I sell you no phony forgiveness, I'm a desperate man - but too much of your life will be lost, its meaning lost, unless you approach it as much through love as through hate. So I approach it through division so I denounce and I defend and I hate and I love.","160": "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.","161": "I wish that strife would vanish away from among gods and mortals, and gall, which makes a man grow angry for all his great mind, that gall of anger that swarms like smoke inside of a man's heart and becomes a thing sweeter to him by far than the dripping of honey.","162": "If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue, or walk with kings - nor lose the common touch, if neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you, if all men count with you, but none too much; if you can fill the unforgiving minute with sixty seconds' worth of distance run, yours is the earth and everything that's in it, and - which is more - you'll be a man, my son!","163": "Whose woods these are I think I know. His house is in the village though; he will not see me stopping here to watch his woods fill up with snow. My little horse must think it queer to stop without a farmhouse near between the woods and frozen lake the darkest evening of the year. He gives his harness bells a shake to ask if there is some mistake. The only other sound's the sweep of easy wind and downy flake. The woods are lovely, dark and deep, but I have promises to keep, and miles to go before I sleep, and miles to go before I sleep.","164": "You have brains in your head. You have feet in your shoes. You can steer yourself any direction you choose. You're on your own. And you know what you know. And YOU are the one who'll decide where to go...","165": "We caught fish, and talked, and we took a swim now and then to keep off sleepiness. It was kind of solemn, drifting down the big still river, laying on our backs looking up at the stars, and we didn't ever feel like talking loud, and it warn't often that we laughed, only a kind of low chuckle. We had mighty good weather, as a general thing, and nothing ever happened to us at all, that night, nor the next, nor the next.","166": "Do I know you? I know you clear through. I was born and raised in the south, and I've lived in the north; so I know the average all around. The average man's a coward.","167": "Would you really dig into yesterday's garbage to make tonight's meal? Do you dig into old mental garbage to create tomorrow's experiences? If a thought or belief does not serve you, let it go! There is no written law that says that because you once believed something, you have to continue to believe it forever.","168": "It is true that those we meet can change us, sometimes so profoundly that we are not the same afterwards, even unto our names.","169": "Well, then, here we are. A little challenge for you all as you embark on your separate doctoral journeys, whatever they may be, Mr. Hawking. Something to separate the men from the boys, the wheat from the chaff, the mesons from the pi mesons, the quarks from the quacks. Ten questions, each more impregnable than the last. Good luck. You'll need it.","170": "I stood on tiptoe, hastily looked around once more, reached into the hole, and withdrew two pieces of chewing gum minus their outer wrappers. My first impulse was to get it into my mouth as quickly as possible, but I remembered where I was. I ran home, and on our front porch I examined my loot. The gum looked fresh. I sniffed it and it smelled all right. I licked it and waited for a while. When I did not die I crammed it into my mouth: Wrigley's Double-Mint.","171": "He was wise enough to know that nothing ever happened on this globe, for good, at which some people did not have their fill of laughter in the outset.","172": "In this grave hour, perhaps the most fateful in our history, I send to every household of my peoples, both at home and overseas, this message, spoken with the same depth of feeling for each one of you as if I were able to cross your threshold and speak to you myself.","173": "I'm so glad you came, I'm so glad you remembered to see how we're ending our last dance together. Reluctantly, cautiously, but prettier than ever - I really believe that this time it's forever.","174": "I breathed in my new surroundings. The air smelled different here, I don't know whether it was the desert air or the dry trees or just that I was far away from the stink of the city, but I liked it.","175": "Are you even listening? Look at me! These kids believe in you, but this isn't about you helping them anymore. This is about you loving all of the attention, and the hero worship. If you care about these kids, I mean truly care about them, you'll turn yourself in before anyone gets hurt. That's what a real leader would have the courage to do.","176": "There was never any more inception than there is now, nor any more youth or age than there is now; and will never be any more perfection than there is now, nor any more heaven or hell than there is now.","177": "You know dad, it disturbs me that this wagon has no seat belts and wouldn't survive a 30 mph impact with a stationary object.","178": "Behold the dreaded toboggan: the suicide sled. Its unique design sends a blinding spray of snow on its passengers at the slightest bump. Note, too, the lack of any steering mechanism. Yes, this sled is truly a hazard to life and limb.","179": "Everybody seeks happiness! Not me, though! That's the difference between me and the rest of the world. Happiness isn't good enough for me! I demand euphoria!","180": "As you can see, I have memorized this utterly useless piece of information long enough to pass a test question. I now intend to forget it forever. You've taught me nothing except how to cynically manipulate the system. Congratulations.","181": "The giant amoeba slides along the kitchen floor. Extending a cytoplasmic pseudo pod, the protozoan engulfs a package of oatmeal cookies.","182": "Well, what do you say? Would you like to be transmogrified?

With the push of a button, you could be a 500-story gastropod - a slug the size of the Chrysler building!","183": "People always make the mistake of thinking art is created for them. But really, art is a private language for sophisticates to congratulate themselves on their superiority to the rest of the world. As my artist's statement explains, my work is utterly incomprehensible and is therefore full of deep significance.","184": "You must not use a calculator to work out definite integrals in your exam. You need to use calculus and show clear algebraic working.","185": "I'm not fighting because I want to win, I'm fighting because I have to win.","186": "Before my eyes, it blocks my path. A high, high wall. What sort of scene is on the other side? What will I be able to see there? \"The view from the top.\" A scenery I will never be able to see on my own. But if I'm not alone, then...

Whoever stops adjusting won't be able to continue forward.","190": "Is \"defeat\" proof that you are weak? Isn't \"defeat\" more like a trial to overcome?

If you remain on your knees like that, then it would be a sign of weakness.","191": "When colors mix they become muddy and messy. But when they all blend together, the final result is the color that wins against all others... Black!","192": "Today might be the chance to grasp the chance to let your talent bloom.

What you need at the start is a little bit of curiosity.","195": "There's no match that you can't win, and there's no match that you'll win for sure.","196": "Everyone thinks that being small is more detrimental than it actually is. Even though being smaller puts you at a disadvantage in volleyball, it doesn't make you completely helpless!","197": "Even if a game doesn't seem clearable at first, after playing it over and over again, you can conquer it.","198": "Spiking isn't just about slamming the ball to the floor. If you keep your cool, you'll be able to see what action to take.","199": "We're not hung up on winning or losing, so it'll be troublesome for you guys to lose. How about we throw the game for you?","200": "The game will be over if you beat him, so isn't it more fun having enemies you can't seem to defeat?","201": "Someone who can't see the opponent standing right in front of him, can't defeat the opponent that lies beyond!","202": "I'm not as tall or as strong as the others, but batting isn't just about power. I want to be a batter that pitchers are afraid to face in a pinch.","203": "I don't know what kind of baseball you've been playing but the best pitches are works of art produced by the pitcher and the catcher working as one.","204": "If it was an average pitcher, he would have given up long before, even so he wasn't bothered by his team's errors, continued to carry his team with relentless pitching. On his back... I feel like I saw a true ace.","205": "Right now, you are still only a sprout of a great big eye-catching flower. That flower is small for now, but very strong. What kind of flower will bloom in the future is up to you.","206": "Making trouble for the team. This is what I was afraid of the most. I didn't want the team's morale to suffer a blow because of me.

So from now, I want you to keep walking like you did until now, keeping your feet firmly planted on the ground. I'm looking forward to your next performance.","208": "There is no shortcut to glory. A player who cannot distinguish between assertiveness and arrogance play is not needed by the team.","209": "Even if we've come this far in the tournament, in sports there is no way to know what might happen.

Every leaf on a tree is different, but these are all the same.","215": "It's no accident, I think, that tennis uses the language of life. Advantage, service, fault, break, love, the basic elements of tennis are those of everyday existence, because every match is a life in miniature. Even the structure of tennis, the way the pieces fit inside one another like Russian nesting dolls, mimics the structure of our days. Points become games become sets become tournaments, and it's all so tightly connected that any point can become the turning point. It reminds me of the way seconds become minutes become hours, and any hour can be our finest. Or darkest. It's our choice.","216": "Remember this. Hold on to this. This is the only perfection there is, the perfection of helping others. This is the only thing we can do that has any lasting meaning. This is why we're here. To make each other feel safe.","217": "Only boxers can understand the loneliness of tennis players - and yet boxers have their corner men and managers. Even a boxer's opponent provides a kind of companionship, someone he can grapple with and grunt at. In tennis you stand face-to-face with the enemy, trade blows with him, but never touch him or talk to him, or anyone else. The rules forbid a tennis player from even talking to his coach while on the court. People sometimes mention the track-and-field runner as a comparably lonely figure, but I have to laugh. At least the runner can feel and smell his opponents. They're inches away. In tennis you're on an island. Of all the games men and women play, tennis is the closest to solitary confinement.","218": "What makes something special is not just what you have to gain, but what you feel there is to lose.","219": "Freed from the thoughts of winning, I instantly play better. I stop thinking, start feeling. My shots become a half-second quicker, my decisions become the product of instinct rather than logic.","220": "You, me, or nobody is gonna hit as hard as life.

Because consumers like to consume a good and its complement together, a change in the price of one of the goods will affect the demand for its complement.","223": "Money is defined in terms of what it does: money is any asset that can easily be used to purchase goods and services. For ease of use, money must be widely accepted by sellers. It is also desirable for money to be durable, portable, uniform, in limited supply, and divisible into smaller units, as with dollars and cents.","224": "Anne said no more until they turned into their own lane.

Stars, too, have their own beginnings, but their own power results in their destruction - Finite. It is those who possess wisdom who are the greatest fools. History has shown us this. You could say that this is the final warning from God to those who resist.","238": "While some enzymes methylate the tails of histone proteins, a different set of enzymes can methylate certain bases in the DNA itself, usually cytosine.

Long stretches of inactive DNA, such as that of inactivated mammalian X chromosomes.","239": "If you had to sacrifice many things to protect one, you're more likely to give up and throw it away. Including the relationships you have in your hand now. Because it's precious, because you don't want to lose it, you hide it away and put up a front. That's why everyone lies. But... the biggest liar of all... was me.","240": "For twelve years you've been asking \"Who is John Galt?\" This is John Galt speaking. I'm the man who's taken away your victims and thus destroyed your world. You've heard it said that this is an age of moral crisis and that Man's sins are destroying the world.

Don't be trapped by dogma - which is living with the results of other people's thinking.","244": "Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important tool I've ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Because almost everything - all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure - these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important. Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.","245": "In most people's vocabularies, design means veneer. It's interior decorating. It's the fabric of the curtains and the sofa.

Not a good place to live. Only in books could you find pity, comfort, happiness - and love. Books loved anyone who opened them, they gave you security and friendship and didn't ask anything in return; they never went away, never, not even when you treated them badly.","257": "I just reflect what I see. The truth. And the truth is... that you should see yourself right now.","258": "You're the most beautiful woman in the world... whether my eyes are open or closed.","259": "We're not kids anymore. There's no such thing as good guys or bad guys. There's just people, goin' about their lives.","260": "When anxious, uneasy and bad thoughts come, I go to the sea, and the sea drowns them out with its great wide sounds, cleanses me with its noise, and imposes a rhythm upon everything in me that is bewildered and confused.","261": "The man that I named the Giver passed along to the boy knowledge, history, memories, color, pain, laughter, love, and truth. Every time you place a book in the hands of a child, you do the same thing. It is very risky. But each time a child opens a book, he pushes open the gate that separates him from Elsewhere. It gives him choices. It gives him freedom. Those are magnificent, wonderfully unsafe things.","262": "We were talking about the space between us all and the people who hide themselves behind a wall of illusion, never glimpse the truth, then it's far too late when they pass away.","263": "You now walk upon the hallowed ground of the Scourge, the Light won't protect you here, Paladin. Nothing will protect you...","264": "In this world where time is your enemy, it is my greatest ally. This grand game of life that you think you play in fact plays you. To that I say... Let the games begin!","265": "Imprisoned for ten thousand years. Banished from my own homeland. And now, you dare enter my realm. You are not prepared!","266": "Tell them only that the Lich King is dead and that Bolvar Fordragon, died with him! Now go - leave this place and never return!","267": "The roots will heal in time... as will the entire world. The sacrifices have been made. Just as the orcs, humans, and night elves discarded their old hatreds and stood united against a common foe, so did nature herself rise up to banish the Shadow forever. As for me, I came back to ensure that there would be a future, to teach the world that it no longer needed Guardians. The hope for future generations has always resided in mortal hands. And now that my task is done, I will take my place amongst the legends of the past.","268": "What punishment awaits us if it be discovered we know not, for no such crime has come in the memory of men and there are no laws to provide for it.","269": "There is green mould in the grooves of the letters and yellow streaks on the marble, which come from more years than men could count.","270": "And in the darkness, in the secret hour, when we awoke in the night and there were no brothers around us, but only their shapes in the beds and their snores, we closed our eyes, and we held our lips shut, and we stopped our breath, that no shudder might let our brothers see or hear or guess, and we thought that we wished to be sent to the Home of the Scholars when our time would come.","271": "When I asked him if he knew Count Dracula, and could tell me anything of his castle, both he and his wife crossed themselves, and, saying that they knew nothing at all, simply refused to speak further.","272": "It was evident that something very exciting was either happening or expected, but though I asked each passenger, no one would give me the slightest explanation.","273": "I thought at the time that I must be dreaming when I saw them, for, though the moonlight was behind them, they threw no shadow on the floor.","274": "Then away out in the woods I heard that kind of a sound that a ghost makes when it wants to tell about something that's on its mind and can't make itself understood, and so can't rest easy in its grave, and has to go about that way every night grieving.","275": "When he had got out on the shed he put his head in again, and cussed me for putting on frills and trying to be better than him; and when I reckoned he was gone he come back and put his head in again, and told me to mind about that school, because he was going to lay for me and lick me if I didn't drop that.","276": "It had taken him weeks to find his way into the great vault, and only the clues given by Murchison's reports had made it possible at all.","277": "He remembered the sound of her voice and the sweetness of her lips, and he loved her.","278": "Human nature will not flourish, any more than a potato, if it be planted and replanted, for too long a series of generations, in the same worn-out soil.","279": "The page of life that was spread out before me seemed dull and commonplace, only because I had not fathomed its deeper import.","280": "He says no one but myself can help me out of it, that I must use my will and self-control and not let any silly fancies run away with me.","281": "He says that with my imaginative power and habit of story-making a nervous weakness like mine is sure to lead to all manner of excited fancies, and that I ought to use my will and good sense to check the tendency.","282": "But all we said, not a word could we drag out of him; I almost felt like pushing him over, so as to change his position, for it was almost intolerable, it seemed so painfully and unnaturally constrained; especially, as in all probability he had been sitting so for upwards of eight or ten hours, going too without his regular meals.","283": "He got so frightened about his plaguy soul, that he shrinked and sheered away from whales, for fear of after-claps, in case he got stove and went to Davy Jones.","284": "It was one of those less lowering, but still grey and gloomy enough mornings of the transition, when with a fair wind the ship was rushing through the water with a vindictive sort of leaping and melancholy rapidity, that as I mounted to the deck at the call of the forenoon watch, so soon as I levelled my glance towards the taffrail, foreboding shivers ran over me.","285": "The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall.","286": "Okay, may I speak now? Because I happen to be an expert on punishment, and I'm not sure it fits the crime here. I mean, Carver made a mistake - well, several really - but... you're different. He's changed. Doesn't that mean anything to you?","287": "And you... how are you any better? Why do humans think they can rectify one evil with another? I mean, it's clearly the first time this reptile has truly loved a woman and this is his reward?","288": "It's not about being right or wrong. There are more important things than that. That's why apologies and forgiveness become necessary.","289": "I would rather look up to my superiors than have them look down on me. Ashamed either way; I will learn in the end.","290": "He was probably about fifty years of age, his shoulders cringed a little as he talked, and his eyes, small and crafty, shifted unceasingly.","291": "Whittington ordered a substantial lunch for himself and his companion; then, as the waitress withdrew, he moved his chair a little closer to the table and began to talk earnestly in a low voice.","292": "He could not hope to sustain his part indefinitely; sooner or later he was almost bound to betray himself, and then he would have thrown away a vital chance in mere foolhardiness.","293": "Although she felt fairly confident that he would not recognize her, yet she would have been better pleased had the guest proved to be a total stranger.","294": "From the way she had studiously avoided looking at him, and her action with the light, he came to the conclusion that the room was overlooked.","295": "Newspapers which had hinted at a general strike, and the inauguration of a reign of terror, were forced to hide their diminished heads.","296": "There was a knock at the door, and she half turned in her chair to meet with a smile her stout landlady who came in carrying a tray on which stood a large cup of tea and two thick and wholesome slices of bread and jam.","297": "In the row ahead of her, and a little to her right, were two people who regarded her curiously as she entered.","298": "Then, before she realised what had happened, the big car ahead slowed and swung sideways, blocking the road, and the cab came to a jerky stop that flung her against the window.","299": "She could not sleep, although she had tried hard, and most of the night she spent pacing up and down from window to door turning over the amazing situation in which she found herself.","300": "We found a blanket, and pillows, down there, and, as you say, it has obviously been a wine cellar, because there is a ventilating shaft leading up into the bushes.","301": "The relief she experienced when he informed her he was taking charge of her affairs and settling the debts which had worried her for three years was so great that she felt as though a heavy weight had been lifted from her heart.","302": "The official listened patiently whilst the lawyer, with professional skill, marshalled all his facts, attaching to them the suspicions which had matured to convictions.","303": "He will merely be around to make the beds, help you dress and perform any other little services you may desire.","304": "He was a short, pulpy man with eyes that looked as though they had seen stars topple and blinked for the dryness.","305": "The boy didn't like this speech, for it sounded like a threat; but he happened to remember he had nuts in his pocket, so he cracked some of those and ate them while the woman rose, shook the crumbs from her apron, and hung above the fire a small black kettle.","306": "They could not go very fast, but they walked steadily; and by the time the moon sank away and the sun peeped over the hills they had travelled so great a distance that the boy had no reason to fear pursuit from the old witch.","307": "This soldier carried a long green gun over his shoulder and had lovely green whiskers that fell quite to his knees.","308": "Then we roused out our fishing tackle and overhauled it, by which time, our breakfasts having settled somewhat, we made all secure within the tent and strode off in the direction my friend had explored on his previous visit.","309": "She seemed only half satisfied, and went back into the house, with an expression of doubt upon her face.","310": "The sun slid down to the horizon, and seemed, as it were, to disappear from my sight, almost with a jerk.","311": "I would much have liked to take him with me; but this was next to impossible, in the existing circumstances.","312": "From somewhere, higher up the path, a stream of water was running quickly in the direction of the great opening, and growing in size every second.","313": "There was no need to be afraid of the creature; the bars were strong, and there was little danger of its being able to move them.","314": "At the end of that time, he reappeared; but now, he was accompanied by an elderly woman, and a large number of donkeys, laden with various articles.","315": "All around, was spread the extraordinary desolation of stillness, that had so impressed me during my previous wanderings across its starkness.","316": "A minute, and then another, and we reached the confines of the wood coming out at last upon the bare rockiness of the countryside.","317": "It has occurred to me, that they may have broken loose from the sun's attraction, and whirled away into space.","318": "Ever and anon they rested, panting; then, after getting their wind, at it they would go again more fiercely than ever.","319": "Thrice he smote that strong, ironbound box, and at the third blow it burst open and a great heap of gold came rolling forth, gleaming red in the light of the torches.","320": "I shall take it with me, for it will be better used for charity and the good of my merry band than in the enriching of such knaves as these.","321": "Rich food was brought them and noble wines, and she had her own pages to wait upon the wants of the yeomen.","322": "In front of the door three merry fellows, a tinker, a peddler, and a beggar, were seated on a bench in the sun quaffing stout ale.","323": "Fifteen there were in all, making themselves merry with feasting and drinking as they sat around a huge pasty, to which each man helped himself, thrusting his hands into the pie, and washing down that which they ate with great horns of ale which they drew all foaming from a barrel that stood nigh.","324": "But now no shout went up for the stranger, but an angry murmur was heard among the crowd, so easily had he won the match.","325": "It is bad enough, in all conscience, to be insulted, but the truth of an insult is the barb that prevents its retraction.","326": "And every once in a while a fish would leap and leave a splurge of bubble and foam behind that you would have sworn was an inserted lace medallion.","327": "She felt that at that moment she could have looked at a gorgon, say, or a cockatrice, or any other trifle of that nature with infinitely greater composure.","328": "Woods became quite certain that there was, at least, one thing she might be expected to rob him of, and wisely declined to mention it.","329": "This was all very well; but they failed to make allowances for the inevitable quarrel and the subsequent spectacle of the gentleman contemplating suicide and the lady looking wistfully toward a nunnery.","330": "His suavity and blandness forgotten in the presence of death, he mounted with confident alacrity to heights of greatness.","331": "When a gentleman grew pressing in his attentions, she more than suspected his motives; and when she eventually declined him it was done with perfect, courtesy, but the glow of her eyes was at such times accentuated to a marked degree.","332": "The room was dark now save in the small radius of its amber glow; beyond that was darkness where panels and brasses blinked.","333": "Learning is rampant in the land, and valuable information is pasted up in the streetcars so that he who rides may read.","334": "He was frankly grateful to her for refusing him; and, the mask of affectation slipped, she saw in him another man.","335": "He was a killer, a thing that preyed, living on the things that lived, unaided, alone, by virtue of his own strength and prowess, surviving triumphantly in a hostile environment where only the strong survived.","336": "Did they walk by the beach of a sea, where the hairy man gathered shellfish and ate them as he gathered, it was with eyes that roved everywhere for hidden danger and with legs prepared to run like the wind at its first appearance.","337": "And two days later, when he returned to his kill and found a dozen wolverenes quarrelling over the spoil, he scattered them like chaff; and those that fled left two behind who would quarrel no more.","338": "Down the neck and across the shoulders, his mane, in repose as it was, half bristled and seemed to lift with every movement, as though excess of vigor made each particular hair alive and active.","339": "In vague ways he remembered back to the youth of the breed, to the time the wild dogs ranged in packs through the primeval forest and killed their meat as they ran it down.","340": "What of the thin and rotten ice he had felt under his feet all day, it seemed that he sensed disaster close at hand, out there ahead on the ice where his master was trying to drive him.","341": "She no longer considered the dogs, and because she was sore and tired, she persisted in riding on the sled.","342": "Again the rope was attached and he was launched, and again he struck out, but this time straight into the stream.","343": "For two days and nights he neither ate nor drank, and during those two days and nights of torment, he accumulated a fund of wrath that boded ill for whoever first fell foul of him.","344": "Two ships that at the distance seemed of considerable burden were heading towards them some five miles away.","345": "Frankness looked out from her hazel eyes which were set wide; commiseration repressed now the mischievousness that normally inhabited her fresh young mouth.","346": "I accept it as the only way to save us all from the certain destruction into which my own act may have brought us.","347": "At her present rate of progress it would be an hour, perhaps, before she came to anchorage within the harbour.","348": "His great face was yellow and seemed in that moment of a preternatural flabbiness; his beady eyes were beadier than ever.","349": "This council shall hold at once an impartial investigation into the affair, and the offender, the man guilty of having given provocation, shall be punished.","350": "But since you chose war and opened fire on me with some damage to my ship and loss of life to five of my men, why, war it is, and your ship a prize of war.","351": "He would cast out the maudlin ideals by which he had sought to steer a course; put an end to this idiotic struggle to make the best of two worlds.","352": "Therefore he perfectly understood why mademoiselle should bound up at sight of him, and shrink back in fear.","353": "For the rest of him, he was tall and spare, swarthy of tint as a gipsy, with eyes that were startlingly blue in that dark face and under those level black brows.","354": "She saw that the end was near, and though she was terrified at contemplation of her loss, still she hoped that it would come quickly now and end the sufferings of the little victim.","355": "They had done their best, and now he was sure they would doubtless remain to die with him in a fruitless effort to defend him.","356": "What it heard was no sound by the standards of human ears, yet to the highly attuned and delicate organs of the beast a message seemed to be borne to the savage brain.","357": "At dawn he stopped to feed, and then he slept for several hours, taking up the pursuit again toward noon.","358": "It was evident that they had been dispatched to follow and bring back this party, and that the signal from the bank was one that had been determined upon before they left the village.","359": "He had no desire to fight now, for he was upon a much more important mission than that of battling with every chance tribe that he should happen to meet with.","360": "All the time he listened intently for any sound which might indicate that the sailor or another were approaching his cabin; but none came to interrupt his work.","361": "That her deck was deserted, though she had steam up, and from the volume of smoke pouring from her funnel was all ready to get under way made no impression upon him.","362": "Rokoff did not hesitate to use rough methods when he found that he was to have difficulty in carrying out his designs.","363": "Throughout its whole length the alimentary canal is lined by a skin or mucous membrane like that of the mouth, only over the greater part of it the epithelium is still thinner than in the mouth, and indeed is made up of a single layer only of cells.","364": "Visiting all parts of the body, rebuilding and refreshing every spot it touches, the blood current also carries away from each organ the waste matters of which that organ has no longer any use.","365": "If you blew down the trunk you might stretch and swell out all the hollow leaves; when you left off blowing they would all fall together, and shrink up again.","366": "Living animals move again and again, and yet need no winding up, for they are always winding themselves up.","367": "The presence of valves in the veins, then, is one reason why the blood moves in one direction, but other reasons, and these the chief ones, are to be found in the heart.","368": "When there is a hole in the chest wall, pulling the diaphragm down does not make any difference to the pressure outside the lungs.","369": "But this coming forward of the sternum means a widening of the chest from back to front, and the falling back of the sternum means a corresponding narrowing.","370": "Yet you know that, busy as seems the street, the turmoil and press which you see there are but tokens of the real business which is being carried on in the house.","371": "They are no longer close against the diaphragm as they were before; and if you open the chest you will find that they have shrunk to the back of the thorax as you saw them in the first rabbit.","372": "As if it were possible in these days for a young and hitherto unemployed architect suddenly to surround himself with wondrous carpets, and gold vessels, and gigantic jewels without attracting the notice of some enterprising journalist.","373": "On the most moderate computation, the total value of these gifts could hardly be less than several hundred millions; never probably in the world's history had any treasury contained so rich a store.","374": "There is a pleasure in yielding to some temptations that more than compensates for the pain of any previous resistance.","375": "He did not know how to get rid of them, but he sketched a kind of gesture in the air, intended to intimate that, while their efforts had afforded the keenest pleasure to the company generally, they were unwilling to monopolise them any longer, and the artists were at liberty to retire.","376": "Secretly he was by no means looking forward to his next interview with her, but she appeared with his bacon and coffee in a spirit so evidently chastened that he saw that he would have no difficulty so far as she was concerned.","377": "Just over the rim of the dome he could see the opaque white top of a lamp on a shelter, where a pigmy constable stood, directing the traffic.","378": "This is an article which by some mistake has been omitted from the catalogue, though it ought to have been in it.","379": "I give you my word of honour that, if you'll only remain quiet and leave everything to me, you shall very soon be released from this absurd position.","380": "Futvoye had already hurried her daughter away, and, though she had left her husband to express his sentiments unaided, she made it sufficiently clear that she entirely agreed with them.","381": "Whether they were extravagant or thrifty, they were equally maligned, and, whatever the fortune they left behind them, they could be absolutely certain that, in a couple of generations, it would be entirely dissipated.","382": "He went outside, sought the shade of a large flowertree, and sat down with his back leaning against the bole.","383": "The language had been learned, after a fashion, as had much of the planetary economics and governmental intricacies.","384": "More carefully now, with his mind inside the amphibian, he examined the structure of its brain and nervous and muscular systems.","385": "Hanlon could read the surface thoughts in each mind, but only occasionally at first could he understand what they were discussing.","386": "One building was lighted up even at this hour, and he shrewdly guessed it might be a place where men drank.","387": "Egon complimented him highly on his act, which he said he had seen twice already, and upon the perfect training of his animals.","388": "You can't write a story until you've felt it. Breathed it in. Walked with your characters. Talked with them. That's why you've come here. To live your story.","389": "A story is like a giant jigsaw puzzle, a jigsaw puzzle that would cover the whole floor of a room with its tiny pieces. But it's not the sort of puzzle that comes with a box. There is no lid with a picture on it so that you can see what the puzzle will look like when it's finished. And you have only some of the pieces. All you can do is keep looking and listening, sniffing about in all sorts of places, until you find the next piece.","390": "She inserted a fresh sheet of paper and began. Under her fingers, the keys rattled and clicked. But although she willed the words to wisp up into long silvery tendrils that would wrap around her and take her away, they didn't. They stayed black and blunt on the page. There was no liftoff. None at all.","391": "I know of a girl who drifted on a colorless sea through a fog of nothingness, and this is the story of how she came to be there.","392": "Do not go where the path may lead, go instead where there is no path and leave a trail.","393": "Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God. And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.","394": "You teach me and I'll teach you, Po-ke-mon! Gotta catch 'em all! Gotta catch 'em all! Every challenge along the way, with courage I will face! I will battle every day, to claim my rightful place! Come with me, the time is right, there's no better team! Arm in arm, we'll win the fight, it's always been our dream! Pokemon! Gotta catch 'em all! It's you and me, I know it's my destiny! Pokemon! Oh, you're my best friend, in a world we must defend! Pokemon! Gotta catch 'em all!","395": "The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall.","396": "Human relationships are like chemical reactions. If you have a reaction then you can never return back to your previous state of being.","397": "Engage people with what they expect; it is what they are able to discern and confirms their projections. It settles them into predictable patterns of response, occupying their minds while you wait for the extraordinary moment - that which they cannot anticipate.","398": "There will be no foolish wand-waving or silly incantations in this class. As such, I don't expect many of you to appreciate the subtle science and exact art that is potion-making. However, for those select few who possess the predisposition, I can teach you how to bewitch the mind and ensnare the senses. I can tell you how to bottle fame, brew glory, and even put a stopper in death. Then again, maybe some of you have come to Hogwarts in possession of abilities so formidable that you feel confident enough to not pay attention!","399": "Sometimes I'll start a sentence and I don't even know where it's going. I just hope I find it along the way.","400": "Do you smell it? That smell. A kind of smelly smell. The smelly smell that smells... smelly.","401": "You have brains in your head. You have feet in your shoes. You can steer yourself any direction you choose.","402": "When you're trying to learn a new technique, first you have to understand yourself.","403": "You are perfect exactly as you are. With all your flaws and problems, there's no need to change anything. All you need to change is the thought that you aren't good enough.","404": "I'm a shooting star leaping through the sky like a tiger defying the laws of gravity. I'm a racing car passing by like Lady Godiva. I'm gonna go, go, go. There's no stopping me.","405": "But now, for the first time, I see you are a man like me. I thought of your hand-grenades, of your bayonet, of your rifle; now I see your wife and your face and our fellowship. Forgive me, comrade. We always see it too late. Why do they never tell us that you are poor devils like us, that your mothers are just as anxious as ours, that we have the same fear of death, and the same dying and the same agony - Forgive me, comrade; how could you be my enemy?","406": "At school nobody ever taught us how to light a cigarette in a storm of rain, nor how a fire could be made with wet wood - nor that it is best to stick a bayonet in the belly because it doesn't get jammed, as it does in the ribs.","407": "Mr. Putnam, I have here an accusation by Mr. Corey against you. He states that you coldly prompted your daughter to cry witchery upon George Jacobs that is now in jail.","408": "I told myself they were not gawking curiosity seekers, but scientists here in search of knowledge. They couldn't help finding these pictures funny - but still, as Burt caught the spirit and made amusing comments on the films, I was overcome with a sense of mischief.","409": "Even a feeble-minded man wants to be like other men. A child may not know how to feed itself, or what to eat, yet it knows hunger.","410": "The last big rains of the year were falling. It was the time for treading red earth with which to build walls. It was not done earlier because the rains were too heavy and would have washed away the heap of trodden earth; and it could not be done later because harvesting would soon set in, and after that the dry season.","411": "She walked close to Gatsby, touching his coat with her hand. Jordan and Tom and I got into the front seat of Gatsby's car, Tom pushed the unfamiliar gears tentatively, and we shot off into the oppressive heat, leaving them out of sight behind.","412": "This is the story of a man named Stanley. Stanley worked for a company in a big building where he was Employee 427. Employee 427's job was simple: he sat at his desk in Room 427 and he pushed buttons on a keyboard. Orders came to him through a monitor on his desk, telling him what buttons to push, how long to push them, and in what order. This is what Employee 427 did every day of every month of every year, and although others may have considered it soul rending, Stanley relished every moment that the orders came in, as though he had been made exactly for this job. And Stanley was happy.","413": "Well, it's no secret that the best thing about a secret is secretly telling someone your secret, thereby secretly adding another secret to their secret collection of secrets, secretly.","414": "I don't get it. I made my house a mess, which was making it clean, which made Squidward clean my yard, but that really means he's messing it up. But the opposite of clean is filth, which means filth is clean, that means Squidward is really making my yard a wreck, but I normally wreck my own yard which means Squidward is being the opposite of Squidward which means he's SpongeBob!","415": "Oh, these aren't homemade. They were made in a factory... a bomb factory. They're bombs.","416": "You can go the distance, you can run the mile. You can walk straight through hell with a smile. You can be a hero, you can get the gold. Breakin' all the records they thought never could be broke. Do it for your people, do it for your pride. How you ever gonna know if you never even try? Do it for your country, do it for your name, 'cause there's gon' be a day when you're standing in the Hall of Fame.","417": "My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all. The morning rain clouds up my window, and I can't see at all. And even if I could it'll all be gray, but your picture on my wall. It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad.","418": "Any momentary triumph you think you have gained through argument is really a Pyrrhic victory: The resentment and ill will you will stir up is stronger and lasts longer than any momentary change of opinion. It is much more powerful to get others to agree with you through your actions, without saying a word. Demonstrate, do not explicate.","419": "Man is the only creature that consumes without producing. He does not give milk, he does not lay eggs, he is too weak to pull the plough, he cannot run fast enough to catch rabbits. Yet he is lord of all the animals. He sets them to work, he gives back to them the bare minimum that will prevent them from starving, and the rest he keeps for himself.","420": "It seemed funny to me that the sunset she saw from her patio and the one I saw from the back steps was the same one. Maybe the two different worlds we lived in weren't so different. We saw the same sunset.","421": "I will make you queen of everything you see, I'll put you on a map, I'll cure you of disease.","422": "Darkness had no effect upon my fancy, and a churchyard was to me merely the receptacle of bodies deprived of life, which, from being the seat of beauty and strength, had become food for the worm.","423": "My sufferings were augmented also by the oppressive sense of the injustice and ingratitude of their infliction.","424": "You throw a torch into a pile of buildings, and when they are consumed, you sit among the ruins and lament the fall.","425": "I threw the door forcibly open, as children are accustomed to do when they expect a spectre to stand in waiting for them on the other side; but nothing appeared.","426": "He turned on hearing a noise, and perceiving me, shrieked loudly, and quitting the hut, ran across the fields with a speed of which his debilitated form hardly appeared capable.","427": "Men who before this change seemed to have been hid in caves dispersed themselves and were employed in various arts of cultivation.","428": "They loved and sympathised with one another; and their joys, depending on each other, were not interrupted by the casualties that took place around them.","429": "The interval was, consequently, spent in inaction; his grief only became more deep and rankling when he had leisure for reflection, and at length it took so fast hold of his mind that at the end of three months he lay on a bed of sickness, incapable of any exertion.","430": "Suddenly the broad disk of the moon arose and shone full upon his ghastly and distorted shape as he fled with more than mortal speed.","431": "If our impulses were confined to hunger, thirst, and desire, we might be nearly free; but now we are moved by every wind that blows and a chance word or scene that that word may convey to us.","432": "At the end of the first quarter of a minute they would be out of bed, and you would be wondering where they picked up such expressions.","433": "There was a large room at the back of the shop, and here oceans of hot tea and tons of toast were consumed.","434": "Before he went to bed that night he put his watch on half an hour, wound it up, and placed it on a chair at his bedside.","435": "It gives the discoverer a weird, lost feeling, as if he had stopped dead while all the rest of the world had moved on at the usual rate.","436": "As has been pointed out before, there was practically one handwriting common to the whole school when it came to writing lines.","437": "The housemaster walked to the window, looked out, returned to the mantelpiece, and shifted the position of a china vase two and a quarter inches to the left.","438": "Wandering round the room he found a chisel, and upon the instant, in direct contravention of the treaty respecting rotting, he sat down and started carving his name on a smooth deal board which looked as if nobody wanted it.","439": "As regards every system of utilitarianism, one may at once assume that it has the same origin, and follow the scent: one will seldom err.","440": "There is, in fine, a gradation of rank in physical states, to which the gradation of rank in the problems corresponds; and the highest problems repel ruthlessly every one who ventures too near them, without being predestined for their solution by the loftiness and power of his spirituality.","441": "For the corruption, the ruination of higher men, of the more unusually constituted souls, is in fact, the rule: it is dreadful to have such a rule always before one's eyes.","442": "The noble soul gives as he takes, prompted by the passionate and sensitive instinct of requital, which is at the root of his nature.","443": "In intercourse with scholars and artists one readily makes mistakes of opposite kinds: in a remarkable scholar one not infrequently finds a mediocre man; and often, even in a mediocre artist, one finds a very remarkable man.","444": "It happens more frequently, as has been hinted, that a scientific head is placed on an ape's body, a fine exceptional understanding in a base soul, an occurrence by no means rare, especially among doctors and moral physiologists.","445": "With these conceits, they take control of the needy as a property, just as in general they are charitable and helpful out of a desire for property.","446": "Cynicism is the only form in which base souls approach what is called honesty; and the higher man must open his ears to all the coarser or finer cynicism, and congratulate himself when the clown becomes shameless right before him, or the scientific satyr speaks out.","447": "When we have to change an opinion about any one, we charge heavily to his account the inconvenience he thereby causes us.","448": "He had often been depressed before, and there was nothing surprising at his feeling so at such a moment, when he had broken off with everything that had brought him here, and was preparing that day to make a new start and enter upon a new, unknown future.","449": "There were pictures on the walls, vases and lamps on the tables, masses of flowers, and even an aquarium in the window.","450": "Smerdyakov drew his right foot up to his left, pulled himself up, but still looked at him with the same serenity and the same little smile.","451": "It was, of course, only a bad, underbred habit that showed bad education and a false idea of good manners.","452": "She was kneeling and gazing with a fixed stare at the elder; there was something almost frenzied in her eyes.","453": "Yet for more than a fortnight afterwards, he came to me every evening, still preparing himself, still unable to bring himself to the point.","454": "And jumping up and running to a handsome bureau with numerous little drawers, she began pulling out one drawer after another, looking for something with desperate haste.","455": "But for that ending a quite different anxiety arose, a new, incidental, but yet fatal and insoluble difficulty presented itself.","456": "They are not servile, and even after two centuries of serfdom they are free in manner and bearing, yet without insolence, and not revengeful and not envious.","457": "He was dressed in ordinary evening clothes, and nothing save his haggard look remained of the change that had startled me.","458": "It seemed to me that the best thing we could do would be to pass the night in the open, protected by a fire.","459": "The delicate little people must have heard me hammering in gusty outbreaks a mile away on either hand, but nothing came of it.","460": "Like the others, it was rimmed with bronze, curiously wrought, and protected by a little cupola from the rain.","461": "And close behind, and overtaking it, and overflowing it, the dawn came, pale at first, and then growing pink and warm.","462": "To adorn themselves with flowers, to dance, to sing in the sunlight: so much was left of the artistic spirit, and no more.","463": "As the darkness thickened, the eddying flakes grew more abundant, dancing before my eyes; and the cold of the air more intense.","464": "She tried to follow me everywhere, and on my next journey out and about it went to my heart to tire her down, and leave her at last, exhausted and calling after me rather plaintively.","465": "That is what dismayed me: the sense of some hitherto unsuspected power, through whose intervention my invention had vanished.","466": "I began to think of this house of mine, of this fireside, of some of you, and with such thoughts came a longing that was pain.","467": "They fought with the fury of the lions, tigers, and serpents of the country, to see who should have us.","468": "It is filled with mockery, with inventiveness, with things as concrete as things to eat and coins, it has time for the neatest intellectual clickings, it is never hurried, and it moves with the most amazing rapidity.","469": "But you have not the same resources as we; certainly it is much better to devour your enemies than to resign to the crows and rooks the fruits of your victory.","470": "You have fared but very indifferently because this is a poor village; but everywhere else, you will be received as you deserve.","471": "The following day they rummaged among the ruins and found provisions, with which they repaired their exhausted strength.","472": "Pitying the poor, he would have shown us poverty as a ridiculous anachronism, and both the ridicule and the pity would have expressed his indignation.","473": "I have fought in defence of them; and above eight hundred of my adherents have been hanged, drawn, and quartered.","474": "Candide gathered them up, ran to the master, and presented them to him in a most humble manner, giving him to understand by signs that their royal highnesses had forgotten their gold and jewels.","475": "Pangloss owned that he had always suffered horribly, but as he had once asserted that everything went wonderfully well, he asserted it still, though he no longer believed it.","476": "There were minor variations from one manufacturer to another, but most typewriters followed the concept that each key was attached to a typebar that had the corresponding letter molded, in reverse, into its striking head.","477": "The term originated when such compound documents were created using manual paste up techniques for typographic page layout.","478": "These machines, and similar products from other manufacturers, used a separate correction ribbon and a character memory.","479": "To overcome this limitation, users typically typed more than one adjacent hyphen to approximate these symbols.","480": "This typewriter convention is still sometimes used today, even though modern computer word processing applications can input the correct en and em dashes for each font type.","481": "When a typewriter had this facility, it could still be fitted with a solid black ribbon; the lever was then used to switch to fresh ribbon when the first stripe ran out of ink.","482": "Typewriter eraser brushes were necessary for clearing eraser crumbs and paper dust, and using the brush properly was an important element of typewriting skill; if erasure detritus fell into the typewriter, a small buildup could cause the typebars to jam in their narrow supporting grooves.","483": "Parton has said in interviews that when writing the song, to mimic the typing keys sound, she would run her acrylic fingernails back and forth against each other.","484": "For devices utilizing replaceable components, such as a typeball element, any association may be restricted to a specific element, rather than to the typewriter as a whole.","485": "With a single keystroke, the typewriter was capable of automatically backspacing and then overstriking the previous characters with minimal marring of the paper.","486": "Given a sequence of jamo, there is only one unambiguous way letters can be validly grouped into syllables, so the computer groups them together as the user types.","487": "Visual layouts vary by language, country, and user preference, and any one physical and functional layout can be employed with a number of different visual layouts.","488": "This may be done through a special key on the keyboard devoted to this task, or through some special combination of keys, or through software programs that do not interact with the keyboard much.","489": "It is also possible to add a second set of characters to a keyboard with keyboard stickers manufactured by third parties.","490": "Resulting text can then be pasted into other web sites or applications flexibly with no need to reprogram keyboard mappings at all.","491": "Besides the character keys, a keyboard incorporates special keys that do nothing by themselves but modify the functions of other keys.","492": "A computer or standard typewriter keyboard, on the other hand, has four banks of keys, with home row being second from bottom.","493": "There are keyboards with two parallel sets of characters labeled on the keys, representing alternate alphabets or scripts.","494": "The layout divides the keys into two separate pads which are positioned near the sides of the screen, while text appears in the middle.","495": "In such cases, each new language may require an additional label on the key, because the standard keyboard layouts do not even share similar characters of different languages.","496": "Several engineers devised hardware and software to remap the keyboard, which were used inside the company and even sold commercially.","497": "The layouts are also used by people with full use of two hands, who prefer having one hand free while they type with the other.","498": "An observation of this principle is that, for many people, when tapping fingers on a table, it is easier going from little finger to index than vice versa.","499": "Dvorak layouts almost always place semicolon and colon together on a single key, and slash and question mark together on a single key.","500": "In the buffer method, the typist looks at the source copy, mentally stores one or several sentences, then looks at the keyboard and types out the buffer of sentences.","501": "This eliminates frequent up and down motions with the head and is used in typing competitions in which the typist is not well versed in touch typing.","502": "Although good accuracy may be achieved, any typing errors that are made may not be noticed immediately due to the user not looking at the screen.","503": "The benefits of a standardized measurement of input speed are that it enables comparison across language and hardware boundaries.","504": "There is also the disadvantage that because fewer fingers are used, those that are used are forced to move a much greater distance.","505": "Some use their fingers very consistently, with the same finger being used to type the same character every time, while others vary the way they use their fingers.","506": "Again consider the integers and fractions together, omitting the points which correspond to the incommensurable ratios.","507": "Then a line drawn with the proper number of inches of length in the proper direction represents the required vector on the arbitrarily assigned scale of magnitude.","508": "We are evidently advancing towards the desired uniform definition which does not go out of the plane; but have not yet quite attained to uniformity.","509": "Everywhere order reigns, so that when some circumstances have been noted we can foresee that others will also be present.","510": "Our limited intellects cannot deal with complicated material all at once, and our method of arrangement is that of approximation.","511": "The result of this continual elimination of definite numbers by successive layers of parameters is that the amount of arithmetic performed by mathematicians is extremely small.","512": "Any limitation whatsoever upon the generality of theorems, or of proofs, or of interpretation is abhorrent to the mathematical instinct.","513": "Both parts of the problem are now known to be impossible; and the insoluble problem has now lost all special practical or theoretical interest, having become absorbed in wider ideas.","514": "There is, of course, the converse artistic method of preparing the imagination by the presentation of subordinate or special details, and then gradually rising to a crisis.","515": "Meanwhile the events of this physical universe succeed each other according to the mathematical laws which ignore all special sensations and thoughts and emotions.","516": "Newton gives first a special solution to the second problem in which he resorts to a rule for which he has given no proof.","517": "In comparing rectilinear figures, the method of superposition was employed by the ancients, but in comparing rectilinear and curvilinear figures with each other, this method failed because no addition or subtraction of rectilinear figures could ever produce curvilinear ones.","518": "Pappus proved also that the centre of gravity of a triangle is that of another triangle whose vertices lie upon the sides of the first and divide its three sides in the same ratio.","519": "All problems previously treated in a special and uncertain manner were referred back to a few general principles.","520": "He shows that the number of grains in a heap of sand not only as large as the whole earth, but as large as the entire universe, can be arithmetically expressed.","521": "His mode of working was, first to concentrate his powers upon a special problem, then to solve separately all problems growing out of the first.","522": "The greatest strength is found to lie, not in the suppression of either, but in the friendly rivalry between the two, and in the stimulating influence of the one upon the other.","523": "Being kept awake one night by a toothache, some thoughts undesignedly came into his head concerning the roulette or cycloid; one idea followed another; and he thus discovered properties of this curve even to demonstration.","524": "These are ordinary single algebra, ordinary double algebra, and quaternions, from which the imaginary scalar is excluded.","525": "There is indeed great doubt as to whether the quaternionic product can claim a necessary and fundamental place in a system of vector analysis.","526": "If through the advancing power of scientific methods, we find that the pursuits on which we were once engaged, afford no longer a sufficiently ample field for intellectual effort, the remedy is, to proceed to higher inquiries, and, in new tracks, to seek for difficulties yet unsubdued.","527": "Our present concern is rather with the laws of combination and of succession, by which its results are governed, and of these it will suffice to notice the following.","528": "Yet there are cases in which such inferences may lawfully be drawn, and in unrestricted argument they are of frequent occurrence.","529": "But if other considerations are admitted, each of these cases will be resolvable into others, individually less extensive, the number of which will depend upon the number of foreign considerations admitted.","530": "The lawful cases of the second class are those in which a particular conclusion only is deducible from two universal premises.","531": "It is peculiar to elective symbols, and will be found of great importance in enabling us to reduce our results to forms meet for interpretation.","532": "I shall in the following example employ this method, and shall only remark that those to whom it may appear doubtful, may verify its conclusions by the previous method.","533": "In discussing the second, and scarcely less momentous question of the influence of the use of symbols upon the discipline of the intellect, an important distinction ought to be made.","534": "Among the cases in which no inference was possible, it was found, that there were two distinct forms of the final equation.","535": "We shall prefer to contemplate the problem of the solution of elective equations under its most general aspect, which is the object of the succeeding investigations.","536": "This principle is indeed of fundamental importance; and it may with safety be affirmed, that the recent advances of pure analysis have been much assisted by the influence which it has exerted in directing the current of investigation.","537": "These are connected together by the copula is, or is not, or by some other modification of the substantive verb.","538": "An expression in which they are involved will be called an elective function, and an equation of which the members are elective functions, will be termed an elective equation.","539": "No inconsiderable part of the pleasure which we derive from the application of analysis to the interpretation of external nature, arises from the conceptions which it enables us to form of the universality of the dominion of law.","540": "Thus the law of what logicians term simple conversion, is determined by the fact, that the corresponding equations are symmetrical, that they are unaffected by a mutual change of place, in those symbols which correspond to the convertible classes.","541": "By assigning an appropriate meaning to our symbols, all the equations we have discussed would admit of interpretation in hypothetical, but it may suffice to have considered them as examples of categoricals.","542": "Every syllogism has three and only three terms, whereof that which is the subject of the conclusion is called the minor term, the predicate of the conclusion, the major term, and the remaining term common to both premises, the middle term.","543": "And it is further to be borne in mind, that although three different forms are given for the expression of each of the particular propositions, everything is really included in the first form.","544": "From the circumstance that the processes of algebra may be applied to the present system, it is not to be inferred that the interpretation of an elective equation will be unaffected by such processes.","545": "They read it just after they had hung up their stockings before one of the big fireplaces in their house.","546": "The fairies take an hour longer in the morning, the beasts attend to their young, the redskins feed heavily for six days and nights, and when pirates and lost boys meet they merely bite their thumbs at each other.","547": "So great indeed was their faith in a mother's love that they felt they could afford to be callous for a bit longer.","548": "Even when she heard the sound of muffled oars, though her heart was in her mouth, she did not waken them.","549": "He was a brave man, but for a moment he had to stop there and wipe his brow, which was dripping like a candle.","550": "This puzzled the pirates, but all their other feelings were swallowed by a base delight that the enemy were about to come up the trees.","551": "They knew in what they called their hearts that one can get on quite well without a mother, and that it is only the mothers who think you can't.","552": "As his eyes became accustomed to the dim light various objects in the home under the trees took shape; but the only one on which his greedy gaze rested, long sought for and found at last, was the great bed.","553": "Then he lay down on the bed outside the coverlet, to vex her still more; for she had always tucked them inside it, because you never know that you may not grow chilly at the turn of the night.","554": "Each feeling for a grip met the other's arm: in surprise they raised their heads; their faces were almost touching; so they met.","555": "Darling such a look, not an angry look: she showed him the great red tear that makes us so sorry for noble dogs, and crept into her kennel.","556": "It was rough and simple, and not unlike what baby bears would have made of an underground house in the same circumstances.","557": "She saw recognition come into his eyes as he was about to pass them the time of day and go on; once even she had to call him by name.","558": "Pale rays of light tiptoed across the waters; and by and by there was to be heard a sound at once the most musical and the most melancholy in the world: the mermaids calling to the moon.","559": "Steadily the waters rose till they were nibbling at his feet; and to pass the time until they made their final gulp, he watched the only thing on the lagoon.","560": "While that smile was on his face no one dared address him; all they could do was to stand ready to obey.","561": "First her voice grew strong, then she popped out of bed, then she was flashing through the room more merry and impudent than ever.","562": "Of course no one really knows, but he quite seemed to know, and he often said stocks were up and shares were down in a way that would have made any woman respect him.","563": "One arm dropped over the edge of the bed, one leg was arched, and the unfinished part of his laugh was stranded on his mouth, which was open, showing the little pearls.","564": "Wendy was sitting on the floor, very close to the fire, so as to see to darn, for there was no other light in the nursery; and while she sat darning she heard a crow.","565": "Flora was so markedly feverish that an illness was perhaps at hand; she had passed a night of extreme unrest, a night agitated above all by fears that had for their subject not in the least her former, but wholly her present, governess.","566": "Grose immediately and violently entered, breaking, even while there pierced through my sense of ruin a prodigious private triumph, into breathless reassurance.","567": "The stamp of publicity had of course been fully given by her confinement and departure, and the change itself was now ushered in by our nonobservance of the regular custom of the schoolroom.","568": "It appeared that the narrative he had promised to read us really required for a proper intelligence a few words of prologue.","569": "Such things naturally left on the surface, for the time, a chill which we vociferously denied that we felt; and we had, all three, with repetition, got into such splendid training that we went, each time, almost automatically, to mark the close of the incident, through the very same movements.","570": "She left it, at the end of the year, to go home, as she said, for a short holiday, to which the time she had put in had certainly given her a right.","571": "He was discernibly trying to take for granted more things than he found, without assistance, quite easy; and he dropped into peaceful silence while he felt his situation.","572": "We waited in fact till two nights later; but that same evening, before we scattered, he brought out what was in his mind.","573": "His eyebrows are, somehow, darker; they look particularly arched and as if they might move a good deal.","574": "Last evening, in the firelight and the silence, he sat with me for two hours as if it were just coming.","575": "A very few of them, in fact, passing, in constant sight of my pupils, without a fresh incident, sufficed to give to grievous fancies and even to odious memories a kind of brush of the sponge.","576": "But she was a magnificent monument to the blessing of a want of imagination, and if she could see in our little charges nothing but their beauty and amiability, their happiness and cleverness, she had no direct communication with the sources of my trouble.","577": "They moved slowly, in unison, below us, over the lawn, the boy, as they went, reading aloud from a storybook and passing his arm round his sister to keep her quite in touch.","578": "I felt a sick swim at the drop of my victory and all the return of my battle, so that the wildness of my veritable leap only served as a great betrayal.","579": "Forbidden ground was the question of the return of the dead in general and of whatever, in especial, might survive, in memory, of the friends little children had lost.","580": "My fear was of having to deal with the intolerable question of the grounds of his dismissal from school, for that was really but the question of the horrors gathered behind.","581": "There were plenty of people to help, but of course the young lady who should go down as governess would be in supreme authority.","582": "Yet when he at last arrived, the difficulty of applying them, the accumulations of my problem, were brought straight home to me by the beautiful little presence on which what had occurred had as yet, for the eye, dropped neither stain nor shadow.","583": "Driving at that hour, on a lovely day, through a country to which the summer sweetness seemed to offer me a friendly welcome, my fortitude mounted afresh and, as we turned into the avenue, encountered a reprieve that was probably but a proof of the point to which it had sunk.","584": "Nothing was more natural than that these things should be the other things that they absolutely were not.","585": "For years I've been rushing around, taking whatever I fancied, not giving a tinker's curse for those I hurt. Yet here I am... with riches and reputation, feeling no wiser than when I left home. Yet when I turn around, and look at the course I've run... there's not a man or woman that I love left standing beside me.","586": "Ah... all Men desire to live by a Code, or a Creed, yes? Yet when pressed, most defer to their instincts rather than the Laws that bind them. But what is the appeal of a creed if it does not yoke all men to like behaviour?","587": "Well, well! The fearsome Edward Kenway speaks, eh? Pray tell us, captain, how to quit this predicament! And tell us what genius you have for sailing a boat with no sails and no rudder!","588": "My son. The day you were born the very forests of Lordaeron whispered the name... Arthas.","589": "I am the lucid dream. The monster in your nightmares. The fiend of a thousand faces.","590": "My boy died at the Wrath Gate. I am here only to collect his body. I made a promise to his mother before she died; that I would cross the Dark Portal alone - whether I lived or died, my son would be safe. Untainted...","591": "What I like about you is that you're passionate! You're analytical! It doesn't matter what it is, you care about it! 100 percent! At maximum power!","592": "An old mouse was running in and out over the stone doorstep, carrying peas and beans to her family in the wood.","593": "Peter sat down to rest; he was out of breath and trembling with fright, and he had not the least idea which way to go.","594": "The scholars were hurried through their lessons without stopping at trifles; those who were nimble skipped over half with impunity, and those who were tardy had a smart application now and then in the rear, to quicken their speed or help them over a tall word.","595": "Just sufficient time had elapsed to enable each storyteller to dress up his tale with a little becoming fiction, and, in the indistinctness of his recollection, to make himself the hero of every exploit.","596": "Certain it is, the place still continues under the sway of some witching power, that holds a spell over the minds of the good people, causing them to walk in a continual reverie.","597": "He who wins a thousand common hearts is therefore entitled to some renown; but he who keeps undisputed sway over the heart of a coquette is indeed a hero.","598": "A small wool hat rested on the top of his nose, for so his scanty strip of forehead might be called, and the skirts of his black coat fluttered out almost to the horse's tail.","599": "His schoolhouse was a low building of one large room, rudely constructed of logs; the windows partly glazed, and partly patched with leaves of old copybooks.","600": "No signs of life occurred near him, but occasionally the melancholy chirp of a cricket, or perhaps the guttural twang of a bullfrog from a neighboring marsh, as if sleeping uncomfortably and turning suddenly in his bed.","601": "On one side of the church extends a wide woody dell, along which raves a large brook among broken rocks and trunks of fallen trees.","602": "Apparently there had been some appalling act of justice recently inflicted, for his scholars were all busily intent upon their books, or slyly whispering behind them with one eye kept upon the master; and a kind of buzzing stillness reigned throughout the schoolroom.","603": "Some seem to have but one vulnerable point, or door of access; while others have a thousand avenues, and may be captured in a thousand different ways.","604": "When his story was concluded, there was much laughter and approbation, particularly from two or three deputy aldermen, who had been asleep the greater part of the time.","605": "Books were flung aside without being put away on the shelves, inkstands were overturned, benches thrown down, and the whole school was turned loose an hour before the usual time, bursting forth like a legion of young imps, yelping and racketing about the green in joy at their early emancipation.","606": "There was something in the moody and dogged silence of this pertinacious companion that was mysterious and appalling.","607": "Not far from this village, perhaps about two miles, there is a little valley or rather lap of land among high hills, which is one of the quietest places in the whole world.","608": "It stirred not, but seemed gathered up in the gloom, like some gigantic monster ready to spring upon the traveller.","609": "To see him striding along the profile of a hill on a windy day, with his clothes bagging and fluttering about him, one might have mistaken him for the genius of famine descending upon the earth, or some scarecrow eloped from a cornfield.","610": "That all this might not be too onerous on the purses of his rustic patrons, who are apt to consider the costs of schooling a grievous burden, and schoolmasters as mere drones, he had various ways of rendering himself both useful and agreeable.","611": "They are given to all kinds of marvellous beliefs, are subject to trances and visions, and frequently see strange sights, and hear music and voices in the air.","612": "Though the night was dark and dismal, yet the form of the unknown might now in some degree be ascertained.","613": "This has ever since been considered a haunted stream, and fearful are the feelings of the schoolboy who has to pass it alone after dark.","614": "When father went off into the wilds he was apt to be worried until he had done something which would in his mind justify the expedition and relieve it from the danger of being a fiasco.","615": "There were, however, occasional open stretches, but during the rainy season, as at present, the grass was so high everywhere that it was difficult to find game.","616": "We searched long and without success for the fourth volume, but as the volumes were published at long intervals, it is probable that the former owner had only possessed the three.","617": "My personal baggage consisted of my washing kit, an extra pair of shoes, a change of socks, and a couple of books.","618": "The result was twofold: the first and most obvious being a sore back for the horses, and the second being that the horses became so accustomed to a continual tattoo to encourage them to improve their pace, that, with a rider unaccustomed to that method, they lagged most annoyingly.","619": "His wife took the baby in her arms to go with him to the wagon, and the children, still crying, trailed on behind.","620": "In fact, she dismissed the matter from her mind, without a second thought; and being occupied in preparations for an evening visit, it passed out of her thoughts entirely.","621": "Western travellers, who have beguiled the midnight hour in the interesting process of pulling down rail fences, to pry their carriages out of mud holes, will have a respectful and mournful sympathy with our unfortunate hero.","622": "Every few moments, when the man spoke, or moved, or smiled, he would start and fix his eyes on him, and then suddenly withdraw them, as the bright, dark eyes met his with such unconcerned coolness.","623": "Elton are by situation called together;

folding his arms tight on his chest and applying the screw.","641": "Campbell consigned to him, and felt a strong personal interest in his being well cared for, and living a secluded life.","642": "And the mere sight of the torment, with his fishy eyes and mouth open, his sandy hair inquisitively on end, and his waistcoat heaving with windy arithmetic, made me vicious in my reticence.","643": "That miserable man would seem for a time to have become convinced of his errors, when far removed from the scenes of his old offences, and to have lived a peaceable and honest life.","644": "So furious had been the gusts, that high buildings in town had had the lead stripped off their roofs; and in the country, trees had been torn up, and sails of windmills carried away; and gloomy accounts had come in from the coast, of shipwreck and death.","645": "Cowering forward for warmth and to make me a screen against the wind, the convicts were closer to me than before.","646": "His figure was a little ungainly, as in the days when my knuckles had taken such liberties with it, but it looked as if it would always be light and young.","647": "Over and over and over again, we would make these journeys, and sometimes they would last as long as three hours at a stretch.","648": "In the moment of realisation, after all his toil and waiting, you cut the ground from under his feet, destroy his idea, and make his gains worthless to him.","649": "When he came to the low church wall, he got over it, like a man whose legs were numbed and stiff, and then turned round to look for me.","650": "Opening one of the windows after that, he looked out into the moonlight, and told me that the pavement was as solemnly empty as the pavement of any cathedral at that same hour.","651": "Dinner over, we produced a bundle of pens, a copious supply of ink, and a goodly show of writing and blotting paper.","652": "Now and then, the sound of the signal cannon broke upon us again, and again rolled sulkily along the course of the river.","653": "Put the case that, at the same time he held a trust to find a child for an eccentric rich lady to adopt and bring up.","654": "Pocket did not object to this arrangement, but urged that before any step could possibly be taken in it, it must be submitted to my guardian.","655": "Here and there, the set of the current had worn down the bank into a little creek, and we were all suspicious of such places, and eyed them nervously.","656": "Some bright jewels sparkled on her neck and on her hands, and some other jewels lay sparkling on the table.","657": "Leaving just room enough for the play of the oars, she kept alongside, drifting when we drifted, and pulling a stroke or two when we pulled.","658": "Presently we saw other torches kindled at some distance behind us, and others on the marshes on the opposite bank of the river.","659": "What would alone have set a division between that man and us, if there had been no other dividing circumstance, was his triumph in my story.","660": "All this made the feast delightful, and when the waiter was not there to watch me, my pleasure was without alloy.","661": "Without encroaching on forbidden ground, we may venture to say that there can be no doubt between ourselves of that fact.","662": "Startop had been spoilt by a weak mother and kept at home when he ought to have been at school, but he was devotedly attached to her, and admired her beyond measure.","663": "We went on our way upstairs after this episode; and, as we were going up, we met a gentleman groping his way down.","664": "They came in again without finding anything, and then we struck out on the open marshes, through the gate at the side of the churchyard.","665": "The garden was too overgrown and rank for walking in with ease, and after we had made the round of it twice or thrice, we came out again into the brewery yard.","666": "Then they were all formally doomed, and some of them were supported out, and some of them sauntered out with a haggard look of bravery, and a few nodded to the gallery, and two or three shook hands, and others went out chewing the fragments of herb they had taken from the sweet herbs lying about.","667": "Our lights warmed the air about us with their pitchy blaze, and the two prisoners seemed rather to like that, as they limped along in the midst of the muskets.","668": "Joe was a very clean housekeeper, but had an exquisite art of making her cleanliness more uncomfortable and unacceptable than dirt itself.","669": "On examination it was pronounced that she had received serious hurts, but that they of themselves were far from hopeless; the danger lay mainly in the nervous shock.","670": "She set the dish on, touched my guardian quietly on the arm with a finger to notify that dinner was ready, and vanished.","671": "Estella smiled with perfect composure, and said she had no doubt of my having been quite right, and of her having been very disagreeable.","672": "From that room, too, the daylight was completely excluded, and it had an airless smell that was oppressive.","673": "While we stood in the hut, he stood before the fire looking thoughtfully at it, or putting up his feet by turns upon the hob, and looking thoughtfully at them as if he pitied them for their recent adventures.","674": "Herbert assented to all this, and we went out immediately after breakfast to pursue our investigations.","675": "If anything goes wrong, you are my ace in the hole.

there could be no mistake, except the fatal one that he had taken on a job too big for him.","691": "Perhaps all romance in its hour of happening was rough and ugly like this, and only shone rosy in the retrospect.","692": "Usually it is shallow, but now it was swollen to an average depth of a foot or more, and there were deeper pockets.","693": "If we can stick it out here long enough, we may trap the whole push and rid the world of a pretty gang of miscreants.","694": "Dougal led them along a sunk fence which divided the downs from the lawns behind the house, and, avoiding the stables, brought them by devious ways to a thicket of rhododendrons and broom.","695": "She took the big pot off the fire and allowed it to simmer, and presently she fetched her boots and umbrella, and kilted her petticoats.","696": "Down in that green place the crystal water gushed and frolicked as if determined on one hour of rapturous life before joining the sedater sea.","697": "A great fire of pine roots and old paling posts hissed in the fine rain, and around it crouched several urchins busy making oatmeal cakes in the embers.","698": "Love to her was only a word of ill omen, a threat on the lips of brutes, an extra battalion of peril in an army of perplexities.","699": "Before him was a tangle of bracken and scrub, and beyond that the gloom of dense pines; but as he could only see directly in front his prospect was strictly circumscribed.","700": "During the war he had been a fervent patriot, but, though he had never heard a shot himself, so many of his friends' sons and nephews, not to mention cousins of his own, had seen service, that he had come to regard the experience as commonplace.","701": "We could always have got in there, but we didn't want to fuss an old lady, so we thought we'd try the inn first.","702": "Presently these excrescences were revealed as linen bags sewn on to his shirt, and fitting into the hollow between ribs and hip.","703": "Through the narrow entrance the gale blew as through a funnel, and the usually placid waters of the harbour were a mass of angry waves.","704": "That everybody should be in love with her appeared to him only proper, for he had never met her like, and assumed that it did not exist.","705": "Spidel fared no better, and the little group on the upper landing saw the two shrug their shoulders and make for the door.","706": "Never in his experience had he felt like this, this foolish childish panic which took all the colour and zest out of life.","707": "As he looks at the ancient tents, the humble equipment, the ring of small shockheads, a great tenderness comes over him.","708": "I will not dwell on his leisurely progress in the bright weather, or on his luncheon in a coppice of young firs, or on his thoughts which had returned to the idyllic.","709": "All the vigour of the morning seemed to have gone out of his blood; he felt lonely and apprehensive and puzzled.","710": "Obviously he had no grudge against the driver, who to his immense surprise was rewarded with ten shillings.","711": "On a table lay the remains of breakfast, and the odour of food mingled pleasantly with the scent of peat.","712": "This was the kind of chance acquaintance for whom he had hoped, and he was prepared to make the most of him.","713": "Two hours of some sort of daylight remained, and the travellers had that impulse to activity which comes to all men who, after a day of exercise and emptiness, are stayed with a satisfying tea.","714": "Saskia ate heartily, speaking little, but once or twice laying her hand softly on her hostess's gnarled fingers.","715": "Below it he could dimly see a thick mass of ivy which would enable him to cover the further forty feet to the ground, but at that cave he stuck most finally.","716": "Madly he ran to the other window of the room, tore back the shutters, shivered the glass, and flung his rifle to his shoulder.","717": "Almost at once the door at the end on the left side was flung open and a large figure appeared flourishing a napkin.","718": "My name is Thomas, he thought. That... that was the only thing he could remember about his life. He didn't understand how this could be possible.","719": "He has of course no use for a careless cutter, who would perhaps waste large pieces of leather; but even the tiniest scraps are of value for some purpose.","720": "It is now sifted through fine silk and mixed with water and finely powdered clay, and becomes a wet, inky mass.","721": "Cards of paper or thin metal are made for each pattern, leaving a hole wherever the hook is to slip through and lift up a thread.","722": "Notice how neatly the ends of the fingers are finished, with never an end of thread left on the right side.","723": "Down below it are some rolls between which the thread from the bobbin passes to a second bobbin which is fast on a spindle.","724": "If you look closely at the outside of a steel pen just above the nib, you will see that across it run tiny lines.","725": "Paper made of properly prepared linen and cotton is by far the best, but there are so many new uses for paper that there are not rags enough in the world to make nearly what is needed.","726": "After so much careful work, it does seem as if not one pen out of a thousand could be faulty; but every one has to be carefully examined to make sure that the cutting, piercing, marking, forming, tempering, grinding, and slitting, are just what they should be.","727": "The silk is taken off the reel, and the skeins are packed up in bales as if it were of no more value than cotton.","728": "They are laid in heaps for a while, then hung in a warm room till the hair loosens and can be easily removed, then soaked in tannic extract and water.","729": "Rubber cannot be melted and cast in moulds like iron, but it can be gently heated and softened, and then pressed into a mould.","730": "Before long it throws out threads from its spinneret, a tiny opening near the mouth, and makes a kind of net to support the cocoon which it is about to weave.","731": "A mill manager who has been very successful has given to those of less experience some wise directions about running a mill.","732": "Its fifteen teeth are shaped like hooks, and it has seven accompaniments, the balance wheel, the hair spring, and five others.","733": "There are many exceedingly cheap pencils, but they are expensive in the end, because they are poorly made.","734": "These are heated, the gloves are drawn upon them, and in a moment they have shape and finish, and are ready to be inspected and sold.","735": "To remove that, they are now put into great boilers full of steam; and here they cook and turn over, and turn over and cook for hours.","736": "In a great vat of pulp a drum covered with wire cloth revolves, and on it a thin sheet of pulp settles.","737": "Something else happens to the cotton while it is in the machine, for a current of air is passing through it all the while, and this blows out the dust and bits of rubbish.","738": "Then was the time when we appreciated the little match and thought with profound respect of the men who invented and perfected it.","739": "At length, however, a consignment of them was packed in openwork baskets between layers of dried wild banana leaves and slung up on deck in openwork crates so as to have plenty of air.","740": "By the aid of this, every little warp thread or cluster of threads can be lifted by its own hooked wire without interfering with any other thread.","741": "Lime and sometimes soda are put with them to cleanse them and remove the coloring material; but when they are poured out, they look anything but clean, for they are of a particularly dirty brown; and the water that is drained away from them looks even more uninteresting.","742": "One separates the warp threads; one drives the shuttle between them; and one swings the reed against the filling thread just put in.","743": "Another method used for cooking such woods as poplar and gum, is to boil the wood in caustic soda, which destroys everything except the cellulose.","744": "As fast as the wood is ground off, it is washed away by a current of water, and strained through a shaking sieve and a revolving screen which drives out part of the water by centrifugal force.","745": "Upon this shelf a bit of the alloy of two exceedingly hard metals, iridium and osmium, is secured by melting the gold around it; and it is this bit which stands all the wear of rubbing on the paper.","746": "Currents of air now play upon the splint, and in about ten minutes the glue and rosin on one end of it have hardened into a hard bulb.","747": "Even the window panes could be made of pulp;

but it was reasonably certain how the acid would behave, for it would always sputter and do its best to spoil some one's clothes.","764": "Bits of leaves and stems are mixed in with the cotton, and even some of the smaller seeds which have slipped through the gin.","765": "These three ideas and five propositions thus became, as it were, hostages for the whole of traditional pure mathematics.","766": "This form of expression is more convenient when it is necessary to indicate which is the variable constituent which we are taking as the argument to our propositional function.","767": "On the other hand, all the particular things there are in the world would have to have names which would be included among undefined symbols.","768": "In the second and third cases, the two boundaries are identical; in the first, they are consecutive terms of the series.","769": "Thus our knowledge in regard to all such collections can only be derived from a definition by intension.","770": "Of the many consequences which flow from the law of duality, this is perhaps the most deserving of attention.","771": "When the said events are not independent, the final system of equations will possess, leaving in abeyance the principle of selection above stated, an arbitrary element.","772": "Any compound event is similarly said to be conditioned if it is assumed that it can only occur under a certain condition, that is, in combination with some other event constituting, by its presence, that condition.","773": "It is a method sufficiently simple in theory, but it has the inconvenience of rendering the subsequent processes of elimination and development, when they occur, somewhat tedious.","774": "If you have talents fitting you for such vocations you are lucky, for these are the ones for which there is the greatest demand.","775": "Not until he wakes up some morning with the poorhouse staring him in the face does he give it serious consideration.","776": "He dislikes business, is repelled by its standards and has no place in any of its purely commercial branches.","777": "This industry would become extinct if something were to happen to sever the connection between external expressions and the internal nature of men and women.","778": "His only chance of compensation for it lies in its use before juries, congregations or large audiences.","779": "The thing we have called intuition, they maintain, is not due to irregular or supernatural causes but to our own normal natural mental processes.","780": "So when he announces they are moving to some other neighborhood, city or state she acquiesces with better grace than other types.","781": "But it was many years before he could induce anybody to finance it, though some of the wealthiest, and therefore supposedly wisest, business men of the day were asked to do so.","782": "Manual shifters are like that. You're not simply pulling a paddle and letting the transmission do all the hard work. The gearbox never does a thing until you command it to do so; you're 100 percent in charge.","783": "Asked about aerodynamics, Reichman emphasized his team's concern for stability, this is a rather fast vehicle after all. This encouraged serious testing to confirm its capabilities, including making use of computational fluid dynamics, a far cry from using tufts of yarn taped to an already-determined form. For a large vehicle, the weight is much less than some of its rivals, in part due to materials choices. The main structure is aluminum, but to avoid the high-stress, high-weight problems of a rear liftgate, the team made the entire frame for the rear opening out of composites and made the lift panel composite, as well.","784": "The Kia Stinger. Despite its stunning good looks and an impressive spec sheet, we didn't quite know what to make of the red four-door liftback when it first rolled up to the front door.

them as she had wandering by the sea accompanied by the old sailor and listening to his fascinating stories.","806": "He was here before the ocean came, and he stayed here because he learned to like the water better than the land as a habitation.","807": "On principle, and when he has the choice, the beginner should give preference to simple and clear development in the opening, rather than to the gain of a pawn, when this involves difficult and intricate play.","808": "Every move or combination of moves should be carefully weighed, and the student should draw his own conclusions and compare them with what actually happens in the game under examination.","809": "Most beginners do not trouble very much about any particular plan in their study of chess, but as soon as they have learnt the moves, rush into the turmoil of practical play.","810": "Conscious of the inferiority of the pawns, the beginner does not conclude that it must be advantageous to employ the greater power of the pieces, but is chiefly concerned with attacking the opposing pieces with his pawns in the hope of capturing them.","811": "If, in moving two squares, a pawn traverses a square on which it could have been captured by a hostile pawn, that pawn has the right to capture it, as if it had moved only one square.","812": "To play logically means to subordinate all combinations to a leading plan of campaign, but there is difficulty in finding the latter.","813": "Open lines for the pieces are the things that matter, and the fewer pawns there are left, the more open lines are available for the

And no message could have been any clearer. If you wanna make the world a better place, take a look at yourself and then make a change.","1391": "I've been watching you for so very long. Trying to get my nerve built up to be so strong. I really want to meet you, but I'm kind of scared. 'Cause you're the kind of lady with so much class. I get my thoughts together for the very next day. But, when I see you lady, I forget what to say. Your eyes and hair, such a beautiful tone. The way you dress and walk, it really turns me on.","1392": "The world is like a ride in an amusement park, and when you choose to go on it you think it's real because that's how powerful our minds are. The ride goes up and down, around and around, it has thrills and chills, and it's very brightly colored, and it's very loud, and it's fun for a while.","1393": "I see your point, Candace. No crazy person would scream at a post like that. I'll be in the dairy section if you want to come yell at some cheese or anything.","1394": "This is Stanky Dog, coming to you on the hottest day of the summer. Unless you live at the beach, I say take it easy and do nothing today. Yup, just find yourself a shady tree and maybe an aquatic mammal of some sort, and just blow the whole day off.","1395": "A platypus? Perry the Platypus? You are mine now! No, that was the garage door opener. You are mine now! And that was the TV remote. You are mine now! Now I shall finally rid myself of you!

I'm just putting the finishing touches of my latest maniacal plan. You see, in a few minutes, I will unleash an unprecedented reign of terror upon the entire... Tri-State Area!

Who do you think we are, some two-bit hacks who will keep writing you songs simply because you pay us obscene amounts of cash? Phineas and the Ferb-Tones are strictly a one-hit wonder.

I mean, I know it's just a battery, but I was thinking... let's open it up and see what this puppy can... Uh, Ferb, we're actually slowing down now. Ferb...? Hello?","1399": "There's something very strange going on with Dr. Doofenshmirtz. He's been very quiet lately, a little too quiet! I want you to find out what's not going on and, uh... put a... stop... to it. I suppose.","1400": "Okay, Candace, this is your beauty shot. The curse has been lifted, and you're no longer a monster. Now this scene is all about what the heart wants, but the mind can't have.","1401": "Okay, boys. Let's have a fair and square fight and in no way should this ensuing fight contain the image of a potentially harmful, hurtful, or psychologically disturbing physical act that could be imitable by an impressionable child viewer.","1402": "Ah, Perry the Platypus. Your timing is impeccable. And by \"impeccable,\" I mean completely peccable!","1403": "Agent P, Dr. Doofenshmirtz is up to his old tricks. He's made fifty-seven phone calls in the past hour. We don't know to whom or why. No, not to Santa!","1404": "Okay, Ferb. If we're going to tackle this fashion design thing, we've got to do something really special. It has to be cool, comfortable... and undetectable by radar. Something that absolutely screams summer!","1405": "Hi, I'm Candace. I'm sure you recognize me from my countless magazine covers. You know, being a supermodel is hard work: the bright lights, the deafening applause, and all those paper cuts from counting my huge stacks of money. That's why I start every morning with Candace-O's.","1406": "Go ahead. Eat all you want. My dreams are smashed to pieces and all you can think about is food. But just remember, Gaston said that I will always be his cou de crayon.","1407": "So, he was totally checkin' me out, when lil' Ms. Pants walks in front of me. Yeah, yeah. So, I was like, \"Um, hello\", and she was like, \"Oh no, you didn't\", then I was like, \"Oh, yes I did\".","1408": "Ah, Perry the Platypus. As usual, your timing is uncanny. And by uncanny, I mean, \"completely\" canny!!","1409": "Any last noises, Perry the Platypus? You know, that little chirping silly noise that you make? That's the one.","1410": "As soon as he walks through that front door, no more Perry the Platypus. It's genius right? Oh! I told Nancy to keep the back door locked. Note to self.

As usual, your timing is incredible. And by incredible, of course, I mean completely credible!","1413": "Beloved Bettys, your band is the biggest, baddest most bangin' buncha babes from Boston to Burbank. I've barely bathed since I began blogging about your bangin' beats. Your biggest Betty band fan, Candace.","1414": "Then I can go on to eliminate all the other annoyances that make my skin crawl. Like, uh... Nature! Beauty! Morning talk show hosts! Soon, there will be nothing that can withstand the wrath of Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz!","1415": "Well, this can't be right. Lemme see those blueprints. Oh, wait a minute. Those are the plans for a Space Laser-inator, apparently. I was wondering what that thing was for. That must be the laser. Good thing we didn't attach it, huh?","1416": "Ah, there you are, Agent P. We suspect your nemesis, Dr. Doofenshmirtz, has been pilfering bricks from buildings across the Tri-State Area. Animals are rioting, convicts are escaping from the zoo! It's chaos! You've got to stop him, Perry, before it all falls down.","1417": "Perry the Platypus, how unexpected! And by \"unexpected\", I mean... unexpected. What are you doing here? This is my week off.","1418": "Oh, hey, Agent P. So, get this, I got this memo this morning on Doofenshmirtz, and someone abbreviated his name in it. Guess how they wrote it? Doof! The Doof! It's times like these when you really appreciate having a cool name like Monogram.","1419": "Perry the Platypus, I... You know, we always do the same thing. I have a scheme, you try to stop me, I trap you, I tell you my scheme, you escape, then we fight, and I'm defeated. Let's mix it up a little!","1420": "Well, that sounds charming, boys, but I haven't played drums since the accident. Fell asleep in a metronome factory, when I awoke I completely lost my sense of rhythm. I've been hanging out here ever since.","1421": "Guys come and look at this! This is an actual replica of an artist's interpretation of what some random guy of no significance believed that the chariot of Asparagus might have looked like.","1422": "Remind me, why did we put spikes on Buford's chariot again? And a bowling ball catapult? I mean, what were we thinking? Why'd we give them all the cool stuff? What do we have? Cup holders?! Sweet! Now we're cooking.","1423": "Perry the Platypus! Oh, your persistence is insufferable. And by that, I mean completely sufferable.","1424": "Hmm, that's funny. I don't remember you saying \"spec\" so many times. Dr. Wexler, you're a platypus.

You just use the future to escape the present.","1426": "Ooh, extra points for recycling. The girls' score is now the square root of pi while the boys still have a crudely-drawn picture of a duck. Clearly it's still anyone's game.","1427": "Good morning, Agent P. Dr. Doofenshmirtz is on the move. We tracked him to these coordinates when we suddenly lost his signal. We have two scenarios to explain his disappearance. First, that magical elves have caused Dr. Doofenshmirtz to vanish to the land of angry corn people. The second is that he may be on this secret hideout-shaped island with the initial \"D\" carved into it, that satellites found at the exact... spot... where... he... vanished... uh. You know what, uh, forget the magical elves thing, way off base with that. Anyway, on your way, Agent P.","1428": "So what you're saying is if I let you go, you'll tell me where my keys are? Oh, for Pete's sake, why didn't you say that like an hour ago? Oh, look, they were under your cute little platypus foot the whole time.","1429": "I woke up this morning and figured I'd call you in case I'm not here tomorrow, I'm hopin' that I can borrow a peace of mind, I'm behind on what's really important.","1430": "I'd like my cartoon character to have the power to be everywhere at once. I'd be called Multi-Man! And Ferb would have a utility belt, and use lots of crazy gadgets! He'd be called... um, Ferb Guy!","1431": "Brothers. Does every sister have to deal with this? No. Do I have to deal with this? Of course. You'd think I'd have better things to do and more important things to worry about. Every single day it's one thing after another. But do Mom and Dad see it? No. Do they get in trouble? No. And another thing...","1432": "Oh! Agent P! It appears that Doofenshmirtz has made some rather unusual purchases: chicken wire, three metric tons of baking soda, and lederhosen. You know, those leather windpipe shorts that make you look like a walking cuckoo clock? Man, he is one sick puppy.","1433": "In computing, source code is any collection of code, with or without comments, written using a human-readable programming language, usually as plain text.

The garbage disposal is backed up again. The same one you fixed last week, by the way! And while you're at it- Oh, who needs to see that?! Oh, I'll be in the other room. Oh, I mean for crying out loud- What, you're done already? But, you've only been here for like, 15 seconds. And I've been talking for like, half of that. What kind of a plumber are you? A platypus plumber? Perry the platypus plumber? Perry the Platypus!","1435": "We belong together and you know that I'm right. Why do you play with my heart, why do you play with my mind? Said we'd be forever, said it'd never die. How could you love me and leave me and never say goodbye? When I can't sleep at night without holding you tight. Girl, each time I try I just break down and cry. Pain in my head, oh, I'd rather be dead. Spinnin' around and around. Although we've come to the end of the road, still I can't let go. It's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you.","1436": "Cry, little baby bunny! Cry, cry... Aw, you don't know when to quit, do you? I want you to remember this moment, the next time you think you'll ever be anything more than just a stupid carrot-farming dumb bunny!","1437": "Felony tax evasion. Yeah... $200 a day, 365 days a year since you were 12. So that's two decades, so times 20, which is $1,460,000, I think. I mean, I am just a dumb bunny, but we are good at multiplying. Anyway, according to your tax forms, you reported, let me see here... zero! Unfortunately, lying on a federal form is a punishable offense. Five years jail time.","1438": "Actually, it's your word against yours.

It's called a hustle, sweetheart.","1439": "I trusted you, Nicky. I welcomed you into my home. We broke bread together. Grandmama made you a cannoli. And how did you repay my generosity? With a rug, made from the butt of a skunk. A skunk butt rug. You disrespected me. You disrespected my Grandmama, whom I buried in that skunk butt rug.

The kind that makes you think you need to carry around fox repellent? Yeah, don't think I didn't notice that little item the first time we met! So l-let me ask you a question: are you afraid of me?

I wouldn't forgive me either. I was ignorant and irresponsible and small-minded. But predators shouldn't suffer because of my mistakes. I have to fix this, but I can't do it without you.

Darling, if you only knew, all the things that float through my mind. But, it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy, baby. When I close my eyes, you come and take me on, and on, and on.

These should be used in preference to using a backslash for line continuation.","1739": "For decades the recommended style was to break after binary operators.

Their pitiless guardian, the only creature who seemed alive in the instantaneous silence, began walking from one end of the dormitory to the other.","1746": "Haskell is a purely functional programming language. In imperative languages you get things done by giving the computer a sequence of tasks and then it executes them. While executing them, it can change state. In purely functional programming you don't tell the computer what to do as such but rather you tell it what stuff is.","1747": "In purely functional languages, a function has no side-effects. The only thing a function can do is calculate something and return it as a result.","1748": "Haskell is lazy. That means that unless specifically told otherwise, Haskell won't execute functions and calculate things until it's really forced to show you a result. That goes well with referential transparency and it allows you to think of programs as a series of transformations on data.","1749": "Haskell is statically typed. When you compile your program, the compiler knows which piece of code is a number, which is a string and so on. That means that a lot of possible errors are caught at compile time. If you try to add together a number and a string, the compiler will whine at you.","1750": "In most imperative languages functions are called by writing the function name and then writing its parameters in parentheses, usually separated by commas. In Haskell, functions are called by writing the function name, a space and then the parameters, separated by spaces.","1751": "Because the else is mandatory, an if statement will always return something and that's why it's an expression.","1752": "In Haskell, lists are a homogenous data structure. It stores several elements of the same type. That means that we can have a list of integers or a list of characters but we can't have a list that has a few integers and then a few characters.","1753": "Ranges are a way of making lists that are arithmetic sequences of elements that can be enumerated. Numbers can be enumerated. One, two, three, four, etc. Characters can also be enumerated. The alphabet is an enumeration of characters from A to Z. Names can't be enumerated. What comes after \"John\"? I don't know.","1754": "Not only can we have multiple predicates in list comprehensions, we can also draw from several lists. When drawing from several lists, comprehensions produce all combinations of the given lists and then join them by the output function we supply.","1755": "A list of numbers is a list of numbers. That's its type and it doesn't matter if it has only one number in it or an infinite amount of numbers. Tuples, however, are used when you know exactly how many values you want to combine and its type depends on how many components it has and the types of the components.","1756": "Tuples are much more rigid because each different size of tuple is its own type, so you can't write a general function to append an element to a tuple - you'd have to write a function for appending to a pair, one function for appending to a triple, one function for appending to a 4-tuple, etc.","1757": "If we write a number, we don't have to tell Haskell it's a number. It can infer that on its own, so we don't have to explicitly write out the types of our functions and expressions to get things done.","1758": "A type is a kind of label that every expression has. It tells us in which category of things that expression fits.","1759": "A guard is basically a boolean expression. If it evaluates to True, then the corresponding function body is used. If it evaluates to False, checking drops through to the next guard and so on.","1760": "Like the name implies, case expressions are, well, expressions, much like if/else expressions and let bindings. Not only can we evaluate expressions based on the possible cases of the value of a variable, we can also do pattern matching.","1761": "Recursion is important to Haskell because unlike imperative languages, you do computations in Haskell by declaring what something is instead of declaring how you get it. That's why there are no while loops or for loops in Haskell and instead we many times have to use recursion to declare what something is.","1762": "Because Haskell supports infinite lists, our recursion doesn't really have to have an edge condition. But if it doesn't have it, it will either keep churning at something infinitely or produce an infinite data structure, like an infinite list.","1763": "When trying to think of a recursive way to solve a problem, try to think of when a recursive solution doesn't apply and see if you can use that as an edge case.","1764": "If we call a function with too few parameters, we get back a partially applied function, meaning a function that takes as many parameters as we left out. Using partial application is a neat way to create functions on the fly so we can pass them to another function or to seed them with some data.","1765": "Mapping and filtering is the bread and butter of every functional programmer's toolbox.","1766": "Lambdas are basically anonymous functions that are used because we need some functions only once. To make a lambda, we write a backslash, and then we write the parameters, separated by spaces.","1767": "Whenever you want to traverse a list to return something, chances are you want a fold. That's why folds are, along with maps and filters, one of the most useful types of functions in functional programming.","1768": "A Haskell module is a collection of related functions, types and typeclasses. A Haskell program is a collection of modules where the main module loads up the other modules and then uses the functions defined in them to do something.","1769": "The Haskell standard library is split into modules - each of them contains functions and types that are somehow related and serve some common purpose. There's a module for manipulating lists, a module for concurrent programming, a module for dealing with complex numbers, etc. All the functions, types and typeclasses that we've dealt with so far were part of the Prelude module, which is imported by default.","1770": "A great way to pick up new Haskell knowledge is to just click through the standard library reference and explore the modules and their functions. You can also view the Haskell source code for each module. Reading the source code of some modules is a really good way to learn Haskell and get a solid feel for it.","1771": "In an imperative language, you have no guarantee that a simple function that should just crunch some numbers won't burn down your house, kidnap your dog and scratch your car with a potato while crunching those numbers.","1772": "If a function can't change anything in the world, how is it supposed to tell us what it calculated? In order to tell us what it calculated, it has to change the state of an output device, which then emits photons that travel to our brain and change the state of our mind, man.","1773": "Haskell's combination of purity, higher order functions, parameterized algebraic data types, and typeclasses allows us to implement polymorphism on a much higher level than possible in other languages. We don't have to think about types belonging to a big hierarchy of types. Instead, we think about what the types can act like and then connect them with the appropriate typeclasses.","1774": "A monoid is when you have an associative binary function and a value which acts as an identity with respect to that function. When something acts as an identity with respect to a function, it means that when called with that function and some other value, the result is always equal to that other value.","1775": "All right, I've been thinking.

It's an empty existence, to go on living, alone and unloved, when defeat's already cost you your dream!","1851": "Are you feeling nervous? Are you having fun? It's almost over, it's just begun. Don't overthink this, look in my eye. Don't be scared, don't be shy. Come on in, the water's fine.","1852": "On a scale from one to zero, are you happy? Cause you're on your own from here, so are you happy? I'm open to suggestions, are you happy? But what kind of question is \"Am I happy?\"","1853": "There exists a limit to the force even the most powerful may apply without destroying themselves. Judging this limit is the true artistry of government. Misuse of power is the fatal sin. The law cannot be a tool of vengeance, never a hostage, nor a fortification against the martyrs it has created. You cannot threaten any individual and escape the consequences.","1854": "The amenities of life have been chasing my soul. And my mind is transcendental, and I'm losing all control. And I'm sinking in the quagmire of illusions and Thoreau. I cry out \"My name is T-Bone\" as a hound-dog digs a hole. You ask so many questions, what answers should I choose? Is this Plato's heebie-jeebies or just existential blues?","1855": "Hey, life is maybe short, but it is still the longest thing you will ever do.","1856": "The practical upshot of all this is that if you stick a Babel fish in your ear you can instantly understand anything said to you in any form of language.","1857": "The Babel fish is small, yellow and leech-like, and probably the oddest thing in the Universe. It feeds on brainwave energy received not from its own carrier but from those around it.","1858": "\"But,\" says Man, \"the Babel fish is a dead giveaway isn't it? It could not have evolved by chance. It proves you exist, and therefore, by your own arguments, you don't. QED.\"","1859": "\"You know,\" said Arthur, \"it's at times like this, when I'm trapped in a Vogon airlock with a man from Betelgeuse, and about to die of asphyxiation in deep space that I really wish I'd listened to what my mother told me when I was young.\" Why, what did she tell you? \"I don't know, I didn't listen.\"","1860": "But look, you found the notice, didn't you? \"Yes,\" said Arthur, \"yes I did. It was on display in the bottom of a locked filing cabinet stuck in a disused lavatory with a sign on the door saying 'Beware of the Leopard.'\"","1861": "\"Ford!\" he said, \"there's an infinite number of monkeys outside who want to talk to us about this script for Hamlet they've worked out.\"","1862": "People living at point C, being a point directly in between, are often given to wonder what's so great about point A that so many people from point B are so keen to get there, and what's so great about point B that so many people from point A are so keen to get there.","1863": "\"I like the cover,\" he said. \"Don't panic. It's the first helpful or intelligible thing anybody's said to me all day.\"","1864": "We are now cruising at a level of two to the power of twenty-five thousand to one against and falling, and we will be restoring normality just as soon as we are sure what is normal anyway.","1865": "If you could save yourself, you'd save us all. Is that what you called me for, is that why you're knocking on my door? The time I've spent, working myself to death. Thought that's what you wanted. I thought you needed my help. To make it good again, to make us strong. To make you happy, to push you along. And gain some respect, to be thrown a crumb. I was on my knees, when you knocked me down!","1866": "If I should leave this lonely world behind, your voice will still remember our melody. Now I know we'll carry on. Melodies of life, come circle round and grow deep in our hearts, as long as we remember.","1867": "They were crying when their sons left, all young men must go. He's come so far to find the truth, he's never going home. Young men standing on the top of their own graves; wondering when Jesus comes, are they gonna be saved? Cruelty to the winner, bishop tells the king his lies. Maybe you're a mourner, maybe you deserve to die.","1868": "If you want to know what's behind the show, you ride my carousel and enter life's jail cell. Love and blood begin to meld, you've lost the self that you once held. Merry go round your head - awake, asleep, alive, or dead. The clown that painted a smile on you, is now the one unmasking you. Animated scenes unwind. Dormant figures come to life. Entangled in your own web, a twisted tunnel overhead. A glimpse of light, a drop of dew. You slide into the swimming pool.","1869": "There was a swirling mass of water that lived in a quiet pond. It asked permission from its master, to visit the lands beyond. And its master allowed it to fly. So the wind swept the whirlpool across the sky. The whirlpool's mother wore a jacket she'd sewn out of dental floss. It was stolen by a monkey, that sold it to an albatross. And it had the idea to fly. So the wind swept the whirlpool across the sky.","1870": "I won't bring no material in the afterlife. Take no possessions, I would rather travel light. I'm of this kind that kills all day but I don't know yet how to die.","1871": "'For I am not going to tell you my name, not yet at any rate.' A queer half-knowing, half-humorous look came with a green flicker into his eyes. 'For one thing it would take a long while: my name is growing all the time, and I've lived a very long, long time; so my name is like a story. Real names tell you the story of the things they belong to in my language, in the Old Entish as you might say.'","1872": "When the sun go down it's the magic hour, the magic hour and outta all the colors that are still up the skies, you got green on your mind, I can see it in your eyes.","1873": "Won't you take me home, and give me wings to fly? We could be alone in the castle in the sky.","1874": "Vade retro, alter ego; move aside, I'm choking on this life. I think I tolerate your hate, as long as you're afraid. All I wanted was to be with you and suffer every day. Under the moon I hold, a wake for a promise torn. Mortally wounded, feelings sheltered me. Once again my shadow will enter your life. Time to walk with me the last mile! I read a book about a man, a love, a woman, how they died. How I was waved aside, listen how the headless doves cry. I truly see a madman in the mirror when I'm weak. I spent a year in love before I realized it's me!","1875": "It won't be long now, love, like mist I slowly fill the room. I place a black candle on your chest, the path of night is manifest. I never wanted us to end up in this catatonic phase. It wasn't me who ran away, you made me stray. Open your blue eyes, tell me that you love me. Make me believe it, oh I know you lie. Broke the vow I thought you made, my angel, why. Settling the score, we pass the twilight.","1876": "Strawberry blonde, your stranglehold on my heart is bound to end. I suppose, life sometimes, it doesn't go the way it was meant. Though you never were a believer, I assure you - I won't die before you. You read the book now, the part: Ashes to ashes, dust to dust. Short is the fight of this little starling. Love sounds familiar, but the emotion escapes me. I will carpe the diem while it's still here. And see how the fear of death becomes her.","1877": "Reporting live from the tallest building in Tokyo. Long ways from them hard ways. Bills and Os and oh-yays. Dade County always, 305 all day. Now, baby, we can parlay or, baby, we can party. She read books, especially about red rooms and tie-ups. I got it hooked, 'cause she seen me in a suit with the red tie tied up. Christian Gris, nice to meet ya, but time is money, only difference is I own it. Now let's stop time and enjoy this moment.","1878": "Eternal night, age of the dying light. Lights in the sky have been fading, winter winds of ice are coming. Prophecies told of a mage of the winter snow, wizard of blizzard, master of ice, wielding magical might. Long long ago, centuries past, he returns with fire and light. Storming through the skies, the stars falling on the night of winterlight. Soaring high above, white fields, frozen on the nights of winterlight. Rise through the ice and a new dawn will arise beyond the night of winterlight.","1879": "I'm waking up, I am alive but I feel so strange. All I remind is the invincible line of the enemies. I see my fall as if I'm living it now. But I'm here, I'm chained to this metal bed. I'm alive, what's happened that day? Where am I now? What is this iron room? Please, help me now! Look to your right, I heard a voice inside my mind, \"You will no longer live your old life\". Inside your cells there's something you're gonna pay: your DNA. I look to the right, I see the planet Earth through a glass. I'm in their starship out in space, I've been captured by alien scum.","1880": "We will steal into your soul. Ride now! Despair and pain inside my heart become a fearful hate. Death pictures in my mind, the start, for me to seal your fate. There is just one thing I'm thinking of. What'd you think milord? Speak, now, to your horde! Dissolution of his power, dust and ash I want! I am your hunter, I'll capture you for all the disaster and pain, you brought to this world. Hate raising up, my heart is burning for. These wounds that will not heal. Take my word this time for real. I am your punisher and my revenge, will strike you fierce and quick!","1881": "And lo, Zargothrax was finally defeated. But in the epic final struggle with the dark sorcerer, the valiant hero Angus McFife realised he had been impaled by the Knife of Evil. As he watched the lifeless corpse of Zargothrax dissolve into liquid dust, Angus knew that soon he himself would be corrupted by the dark power of that cursed blade. And so he resolved that he must make the final sacrifice for the Glory of Dundee. He would end his own life by descending into the raging volcanic fires of Schiehallion!","1882": "Such a pathetic display of valor! You are naught but insignificant worms before the infinite power of Zargothrax! Now, the solar conjunction is at hand, my ascension to godhood is inevitable! And there is NOTHING you can do to stop me. Worship my omnipotence!","1883": "Now I face out, I hold out, I reach out to the truth of my life seeking to seize on the whole moment. Yeah, naked truth lies only if you realize, appearing in nobody's eyes till they sterilize. Stop the guerrilla warfare to keep it fair, bro, change your rage to a smarter greater cause, you know the stake is high stardom is near. Those who sympathized, you die killers pass by. Do not waste your time in hating flirting guys. Use your might to AIs do justice to them all.","1884": "What's become of the world, the colors unfurl revealing a blackened haze. Conditioned to fear, the voice that we hear calling the end of days. Millions of souls under control like pawns to a king, led by a string to the final hour. Lords of technology that fell into the void. Oh shall it be as it was before. Tragedy on every shore. Is this the end of all we know. Innocence lost so long ago. Woven in dreams, the darkest of schemes now takes hold of our destiny. Decades of greed, plague, famine and war, we can't go on like this anymore. Living like fools, chaos will rule this eternal paradise.","1885": "Alone I walk among the twisting shadows, tempted by the ancient magic: the Power of Five. My desire to mirror my own image and I will offer you no soul - offer you no soul. Tonight darkness will shadow the light. Symmetry divine, there's no force greater dividing the Fathers of Time. Feel my hate, I'm banished to this wasteland. My Serpents plot the overthrow of your temples and shrines. In the night, my army's rage and fury burning my shadow into the land, vengeance by my hand.","1886": "Was I sure of my fateful wish to evoke the night from the day? Thousands now join as one - be afraid. What have I done? Clouds are dimming the sun with his wrath of disease and decay. This masque of vengeance leads my death parade.","1887": "Born from the light, journey into the moment delivered from thought and sky. He will be one, one with the land. Lord of wind and the sea and the sands. The one, the bringer of life. All will bear a part of me - let this hollow shell set you free to live as one. Here we are, children of sun and stars. The first to know and to understand. Living by the law of the ages, prophets and sages, forging utopia.","1888": "Great Ptah, Khnemu, sacred priest of the temple of Ra and the keeper of truth. Crystalline spheres, the power of light grant us keys to the stars and the secrets of flight. Five shall be as One. We unlock the mysteries of knowledge and technology.","1889": "Bow down to me, we will never understand, then take my hand and you will see, we will see. You will see paradise, a paradise, of pain and death awaiting for you all, we'll decide the future. Lost evermore the essence of truth, although she tried in vain to bring us peace, it will ever rest in our hands. We've cried a thousand tears for all we had, and all the things we could have been, we must find our way again.","1890": "They bring me down, all the world is stereotypical, playing out rules, but act out another. Look now, you thought you had me by the upper-hand, but I see through the face you've covered cynical. Four, unleash the beast that lies inside of you. Three, take on the fire that burns in front of you. Two, let out the fear you feel surrounding you. One, become the soul that you were born to be.","1891": "Don't be afraid, go straight on, 'cause no one knows what the future holds. Past regrets and loneliness. I gave it a lot of thought to see the light. I must go on for all time and never return! I have to say goodbye and it's breaking my heart forever. I wish to carry on, but there's so many places in this world. I'm following my destiny, crossing the valleys, the seven seas all over the earth and I'm swearing on my honour to dethrone the prince of the world.","1892": "After the nightmares, weak is our mind. It could be the devil hiding inside everyone. Throughout these visions, it's reality, but now it makes me wonder should I carry on my way. So close to the edge, black is the night. From here to madness there's only a short step to die. Lost in the trouble, eternally I am crawling in the fire and reaching eternity. Far away beyond the sky. I come alive again screaming in the wild, resound everywhere.","1893": "The light is in the air. I still believe cold is my way. I'll do all in my power to leave the pain just behind me, use your mind, relieve your soul. Head into the wind, cold is my way, make my mind go blank to leave regrets. Just behind me, use your mind to rise above. With all your might, use your mind and relieve your soul.","1894": "I try to enter deep inside and devour everything. All I need is power to take control till destroying. To see the light of the seven signs and reach the prophecy. All I feel is anger inside to take control till destroying. To break down till the end. Just hide away into your mind, there is no place for me to die. Call me invincible spy, fear and panic everywhere. You can pass away, I'll keep your soul and all remains. I'm vicious caller, tears and chaos everywhere, end is not so far away.","1895": "The dark side of the realm, get behind, the secret of the beast. Get behind, you will find my hideout. It's too late all is done, I just bring bloodshed and cries. And the day will come here below when the light will cross my destiny. Domination to succeed to the crown, just remember the man you used to be. Cause when the virus comes it's time for victory.","1896": "From the dark, we walk to the light. From the shadows we learn to survive. When there's nothing to hide we will find what comes next after light. Destroy, rebuild, now, now, destroy, rebuild, now, now. I hear the angels sing but I hear the demons louder. Destruction chasing me, pulling me under. Pulling me under now, I'm dying to get out. We will never be the same again. From the dark we walk to the light from the shadows we learn to survive when there's nothing to hide we will find what comes next after light.","1897": "Ride from the mountains and rise from the seas. Steel of the warriors, you bow to your knees. Sail through the darkness, the true prophecy. Cursed is the night in the sea of dreams. A blaze of light beyond the eastern sky. The stairs of doom towards the ivory tower. A vengeful death that waits for all this time. The judgement has passed, we all now die. A mess of torment for a thousand souls. The unseen fury of the ancient scrolls. The years of torture that have been foretold. A lifetime of fear, they now behold.","1898": "Lost in a dream, finally it seems, emptiness and everlasting madness. See the sadness grow, watching as we know, long before our journey for the world. Call for us, the power in all of us. So far beyond the blackened sky tonight. Glorious, forever more in us, we are victorious, and so alive. We'll all find our sacrifice tomorrow, our journey on towards a brighter day. Silent tears we left behind, still so far away, across the endless sands through the fields of our despair. Free for all eternity, we stand. Rise above the universe tonight, Starchaser.","1899": "Hiding in the fog where darkness meets the moonlight I will sing a melody till the morning comes. Living for you only, take my hand and show me. There will be much sorrow when the morning comes. Fearless I'm fighting the pain burns inside of me; find the forces of my soul. No one can understand me, am I condemned to ride the blackest night alone? Tragic painting on the walls. In this castle where affliction reigns so many died in vain, hear their distant cries. Never again!","1900": "I will tell you the story of the surprise on that day. I will tell why I am doing so. I did not expect a thing and it's a wonderful thing for my way of life. He said \"Do you wanna touch a star? Do you wanna shine more than ever?\", I said \"I wanna do so by all meanings\". I thought such a chance was rare. I got excited very much. At that time I didn't hesitate to make up my mind. Now I feel the change slowly but surely. Oh can I catch the star like everyone else? I know I should 'cause I wanna get it, ready, fly high!","1901": "When the night meets the day, I'll be watchin' the red sky. Hear the whisper of wind, take a power that never end. History tells a lie: we don't believe in the Darkest Age. Change the time of the gloom; we just fight for the freedom. From the past I'm hearing there is a voice that's calling me. Just feel the fire it's never end. On through the night, we are striding on and on. Hear your voices, spreading your wings and fly away. I just feel your power of the steel, so I'll never die in the heat. I just feel your power of the steel, so I'll never die.","1902": "No animal in England knows the meaning of happiness or leisure after he is a year old. No animal in England is free. The life of an animal is misery and slavery: that is the plain truth.","1903": "Man is the only creature that consumes without producing. He does not give milk, he does not lay eggs, he is too weak to pull the plough, he cannot run fast enough to catch rabbits. Yet he is lord of all the animals.","1904": "Is it not crystal clear, then, comrades, that all the evils of this life of ours spring from the tyranny of human beings?","1905": "And remember, comrades, your resolution must never falter. No argument must lead you astray. Never listen when they tell you that Man and the animals have a common interest, that the prosperity of the one is the prosperity of the others. It is all lies.","1906": "Man serves the interests of no creature except himself. And among us animals let there be perfect unity, perfect comradeship in the struggle. All men are enemies. All enemies are comrades.","1907": "Weak or strong, clever or simple, we are all brothers. No animal must ever kill any other animal. All animals are equal.","1908": "Many years ago, when I was a little pig, my mother and the other sows used to sing an old song of which they knew only the tune and the first three words. I had known that tune in my infancy, but it had long since passed out of my mind. Last night, however, it came back to me in my dream.","1909": "Beasts of England, beasts of Ireland, beasts of every land and clime, hearken well and spread my tidings of the golden future time.","1910": "They did not know when the Rebellion predicted by Major would take place, they had no reason for thinking that it would be within their own lifetime, but they saw clearly that it was their duty to prepare for it.","1911": "These three had elaborated old Major's teachings into a complete system of thought, to which they gave the name of Animalism.","1912": "The stupidest questions of all were asked by Mollie, the white mare. The very first question she asked Snowball was: \"Will there still be sugar after the Rebellion?\"","1913": "In Sugarcandy Mountain it was Sunday seven days a week, clover was in season all the year round, and lump sugar and linseed cake grew on the hedges. The animals hated Moses because he told tales and did no work, but some of them believed in Sugarcandy Mountain, and the pigs had to argue very hard to persuade them that there was no such place.","1914": "A minute later all five of them were in full flight down the cart-track that led to the main road, with the animals pursuing them in triumph.","1915": "For the first few minutes the animals could hardly believe in their good fortune. The first act was to gallop in a body right around the boundaries of the farm, as though to make quite sure that no human being was hiding anywhere upon it; then they raced back to the farm buildings to wipe out the last traces of Jones' hated reign.","1916": "Then they made a tour of inspection of the whole farm and surveyed with speechless admiration the ploughland, the hayfield, the orchard, the pool, the spinney. It was as though they had never seen these things before, and even now they could hardly believe that it was all their own.","1917": "A unanimous resolution was passed on the spot that the farmhouse should be preserved as a museum. All were agreed that no animal must ever live there.","1918": "They explained that by their studies of the past three months the pigs had succeeded in reducing the principles of Animalism to seven commandments. These seven commandments would now be inscribed on the wall; they would form an unalterable law by which all the animals on Animal Farm must live for ever after.","1919": "So the animals trooped down to the hayfield to begin the harvest, and when they came back in the evening it was noticed that the milk had disappeared.","1920": "In the end they finished the harvest in two days less time than it had usually taken Jones and his men. Moreover, it was the biggest harvest that the farm had ever seen. There was not wastage whatever; the hens and ducks with their sharp eyes had gathered up the very last stalk. And not an animal on the farm had stolen so much as a mouthful.","1921": "With the worthless parasitical human beings gone, there was more for everyone to eat. There was more leisure too, inexperienced though the animals were.","1922": "On Sundays there was no work. Breakfast was an hour later than usual, and after breakfast there was a ceremony which was observed every week without fail.","1923": "The reading and writing classes, however, were a great success. By autumn almost every animal on the farm was literate in some degree.","1924": "After much thought Snowball declared that the Seven Commandments could in effect be reduced to a single maxim, namely: \"Four legs good, two legs bad\".","1925": "We pigs are brainworkers. The whole management and organization of this farm depend on us. Day and night we are watching over your welfare. It is for your sake that we drink that milk and eat those apples.","1926": "These two disliked each other so much that it was difficult for them to come to any agreement, even in defence of their own interests.","1927": "Nevertheless, they were both thoroughly frightened by the Rebellion on Animal Farm, and very anxious to prevent their own animals from learning too much about it.","1928": "Any animal caught singing it was given a flogging on the spot. And yet the song was irrepressible. The blackbirds whistled it in the hedges, the pigeons cooed it in the elms, it got into the din of the smithies and the tune of the church bells. And when the human beings listened to it, they secretly trembled, hearing in it a prophecy of their future doom.","1929": "All the pigeons, to the number of thirty-five, flew to and fro over the men's heads and muted upon them from mid-air; and while the men were dealing with this, the geese, who had been hiding behind the hedge, rushed out and pecked viciously at the calves of their legs.","1930": "The men gave a shout of triumph. They saw, as they imagined, their enemies in flight, and they rushed after them in disorder.","1931": "There was not an animal on the farm that did not take vengeance on them after his own fashion. Even the cat suddenly leapt off a roof onto a cowman's shoulders and sank her claws in his neck, at which he yelled horribly. At a moment when the opening was clear, the men were glad enough to rush out of the yard and make a bolt for the main road.","1932": "All the men were gone except one. Back in the yard Boxer was pawing with his hoof at the stable-lad who lay face down in the mud, trying to turn him over. The boy did not stir.","1933": "There was much discussion as to what the battle should be called. In the end, it was named the Battle of the Cowshed, since that was where the ambush had been sprung.","1934": "He gave his orders quickly, and in a couple of minutes every animal was at his post.","1935": "On every kind of pretext she would run away from work and go to the drinking pool, where she would stand foolishly gazing at her own reflection in the water.","1936": "A thought struck Clover. Without saying anything to the others she went to Mollie's stall and turned over the straw with her hoof. Hidden under the straw was a little pile of lump sugar and several bunches of ribbon of different colours.","1937": "In January there came bitterly hard weather. The earth was like iron, and nothing could be done in the fields.","1938": "It had come to be accepted that the pigs, who were manifestly cleverer than the other animals, should decide all questions of farm policy, though their decisions had to be ratified by a majority vote.","1939": "But of all their controversies, none was so bitter as the one that took place over the windmill.","1940": "In the long pasture, not far from the farm buildings, there was a small knoll which was the highest point on the farm.","1941": "This would light the stalls and warm them in winter, and would also run a circular saw, a chaff-cutter, a mangel-slicer and an electric milking machine.","1942": "Benjamin was the only animal who did not side with either faction. He refused to believe either that food would become more plentiful or that the windmill would save work. Windmill or no windmill, he said, life would go on as it had always gone on - that is, badly.","1943": "The animals listened first to Napoleon, then to Snowball, and could not make up their minds which was right; indeed they always found themselves in agreement with the one who was speaking at the moment.","1944": "He was running as only a pig can run, but the dogs were close on his heels. Suddenly he slipped and it seemed certain that they had him. Then he was up again, running faster than ever, then the dogs were gaining on him again.","1945": "The animals would still assemble on Sunday mornings to salute the flag, sing \"Beasts of England\" and receive their orders for the week; but there would be no more debates.","1946": "Do not imagine, comrades, that leadership is a pleasure! On the contrary, it is a deep and heavy responsibility.","1947": "A special committee of pigs had been at work upon them for the past three weeks. The building of the windmill, with various other improvements, was expected to take two years.","1948": "The animals were not certain what the word meant, but Squealer spoke so persuasively, and the dogs who happened to be with him growled so threateningly, that they accepted his explanation without further questions.","1949": "All that year the animals worked like slaves. But they were happy in their work; they grudged no effort or sacrifice, well aware that everything that they did was for the benefit of themselves and those of their kind who would come after them, and not for a pack of idle thieving human beings.","1950": "But the problem the animals could not at first solve was how to break up the stone into pieces of suitable size. There seemed no way of doing this except with picks and crowbars, which no animal could use, because no animal could stand on his hind legs.","1951": "And in many ways the animal method of doing things was more efficient and saved labour. Such jobs as weeding, for instance, could be done with a thoroughness impossible to human beings.","1952": "From now onwards Animal Farm would engage in trade with the neighbouring farms: not, of course, for any commercial purpose but simply in order to obtain certain materials which were urgently necessary.","1953": "The animals watched his coming and going with a kind of dread, and avoided him as much as possible.","1954": "The human beings did not hate Animal Farm any less now that it was prospering, indeed they hated it more than ever.","1955": "They would meet in the public houses to prove to one another by means of diagrams that the windmill was bound to fall down, or that if it did stand up, then that it would never work. And yet, against their will, they had developed a certain respect for the efficiency with which the animals were managing their own affairs.","1956": "With some difficulty Muriel spelt it out. \"It says, 'No animal shall sleep in a bed with sheets'\", she announced finally.","1957": "Curiously enough, Clover had not remembered that the Fourth Commandment mentioned sheets; but as it was there on the wall, it must have done so.","1958": "And when, some days afterwards, it was announced that from now on the pigs would get up an hour later in the mornings than the other animals, no complaint was made about that either.","1959": "Yes, there it lay, the fruit of all their struggles, levelled to its foundations, the stones they had broken and carried so laboriously scattered all around.","1960": "We will teach this miserable traitor that he cannot undo our work so easily. Remember comrades, there must be no alteration in our plans: they shall be carried out to the day. Forward, comrades!","1961": "For a long time the quarry was full of snowdrifts and nothing could be done. Some progress was made in the dry frosty weather that followed, but it was cruel work, and the animals could not feel so hopeful about it as they had felt before.","1962": "Napoleon ordered the almost empty bins in the store-shed to be filled nearly to the brim with sand, which was then covered up with what remained of the grain and meal. On some suitable pretext Whymper was led through the store-shed and allowed to catch a glimpse of the bins. He was deceived, and continued to report to the outside world that there was no food shortage on Animal Farm.","1963": "Napoleon acted swiftly and ruthlessly. He ordered the hens' rations to be stopped, and decreed that any animal giving so much as a grain of corn to a hen should be punished by death. The dogs saw to it that these orders were carried out.","1964": "Every night, it was said, he came creeping in under cover of darkness and performed all kinds of mischief. He stored the corn, he upset the milk-pails, he broke the eggs, he tramped the seed-beds, he gnawed the bark off the fruit trees.","1965": "Napoleon decreed that there should be a full investigation into Snowball's activities. With his dogs in attendance he set out and made a careful tour of inspection of the farm buildings, the other animals following at a respectful distance.","1966": "The animals were thoroughly frightened. It seemed to them as though Snowball were some kind of invisible influence, pervading the air about them and menacing them with all kinds of dangers.","1967": "But we were all wrong, comrades. Do you know what the real reason was? Snowball was in league with Jones from the very start! He was Jones's secret agent all the time. It has all been proved by documents which he left behind him and which we have only just discovered.","1968": "Even Boxer, who seldom asked questions, was puzzled. He lay down, tucked his fore hoofs beneath him, shut his eyes, and with a hard effort managed to formulate his thoughts.","1969": "The plot was for Snowball, at the critical moment, to give the signal for flight and leave the field to the enemy. And he very nearly succeeded - I will even say, comrades, he would have succeeded if it had not been for our heroic Leader, Comrade Napoleon.","1970": "\"Ah, that is different!\" said Boxer. \"If Comrade Napoleon says it, it must be right.\"","1971": "\"That is the true spirit, comrade!\" cried Squealer, but it was noticed he cast a very ugly look at Boxer with his little twinkling eyes.","1972": "He turned to go, then paused and added impressively: 'I warn every animal on this farm to keep his eyes very wide open. For we have reason to think that some of Snowball's secret agents are lurking among us at this moment!'","1973": "Presently the tumult died down. The four pigs waited, trembling, with guilt written on every line of their countenances.","1974": "They did not know which was more shocking - the treachery of the animals who had leagued themselves with Snowball, or the cruel retribution they had just witnessed.","1975": "I do not understand it. I would not have believed that such things could happen on our farm. It must be due to some fault in ourselves. The solution, as I see it, is to work harder. From now onwards I shall get up a full hour earlier in the mornings.","1976": "It was a clear spring evening. The grass and the bursting hedges were gilded by the level rays of the sun.","1977": "The other animals sitting round her took it up, and they said it three times over - very tunefully, but slowly and mournfully, in a way they had never sung it before.","1978": "\"It is no longer needed comrade,\" said Squealer stiffly. \"'Beasts of England' was the song of the Rebellion. But the Rebellion is now completed.\"","1979": "In \"Beasts of England\" we expressed our longing for a better society in days to come. But that society has now been established. Clearly this song has no longer any purpose.","1980": "But they saw now that the Commandment had not been violated; for clearly there was good reason for killing the traitors who had leagued themselves with Snowball.","1981": "In the middle of the summer the animals were alarmed to hear that three hens had come forward and confessed that, inspired by Snowball, they had entered into a plot to murder Napoleon.","1982": "Four dogs guarded his bed at night, one at each corner, and a young pig named Pinkeye was given the task of tasting all his food before he ate it, lest it should be poisoned.","1983": "As the summer wore on, and the windmill neared completion, the rumours of an impending treacherous attack grew stronger and stronger.","1984": "The wheat crop was full of weeds, and it was discovered that on one of his nocturnal visits Snowball had mixed weed seeds with the seed corn.","1985": "Tired out but proud, the animals walked round and round their masterpiece, which appeared even more beautiful in their eyes than when it had been built the first time.","1986": "The next moment a choking roar of rage sounded from Napoleon's apartments. The news of what had happened sped round the farm like wildfire. Banknotes were forgeries! Frederick had got the timber for nothing!","1987": "Two of the men had produced a crowbar and a sledge hammer. They were going to knock the windmill down. 'Impossible!' cried Napoleon.","1988": "When they got up again a huge cloud of black smoke was hanging where the windmill had been. Slowly the breeze drifted it away. The windmill had ceased to exist!","1989": "A mighty cry for vengeance went up, and without waiting for further orders they charged forth in a body and made straight for the enemy. This time they did not heed the cruel pellets that swept over them like hail.","1990": "Slowly they began to limp back towards the farm. The sight of their dead comrades stretched upon the grass moved some of them to tears. And for a little while they halted in sorrowful silence at the place where the windmill once stood.","1991": "What matter? We will build another windmill. We will build six windmills if we feel like it. You do not appreciate, comrade, the mighty thing that we have done. The enemy was in occupation of this very ground that we stand upon. And now - thanks to the leadership of Comrade Napoleon - we have won every inch of it back again!","1992": "They had thought that the Fifth Commandment was 'No animal shall drink alcohol', but there were two words that they had forgotten. Actually the Commandment read: 'No animal shall drink alcohol to excess.'","1993": "A too-rigid equality in rations, Squealer explained, would have been contrary to the principles of Animalism.","1994": "There were many more mouths to feed now. In the autumn the four sows had all littered about simultaneously, producing thirty-one young pigs between them. The young pigs were piebald, and as Napoleon was the only boar on the farm, it was possible to guess at their parentage.","1995": "About this time, too, it was laid down as a rule that when a pig and any other animal met on the path, the other animal must stand aside: and also that all pigs, of whatever degree, were to have the privilege of wearing green ribbons on their tails on Sunday.","1996": "The animals sniffed the air hungrily and wondered whether a warm mash was being prepared for their supper. But no warm mash appeared, and on the following Sunday it was announced that from onwards all barley would be reserved for the pigs.","1997": "In April, Animal Farm was proclaimed a Republic, and it became necessary to elect a President. There was only one candidate, Napoleon, who was elected unanimously.","1998": "\"Alfred Simmonds, Horse Slaughterer and Glue Boiler, Willingdon. Dealer in Hides and Bonemeal. Kennels Supplied.\" Do you not understand what that means? They are taking Boxer to the knacker's!","1999": "The animals were all at work weeding turnips under the supervision of a pig, when they were astonished to see Benjamin come galloping from the direction of the farm buildings, braying at the top of his voice.","2000": "Here Squealer's demeanour suddenly changed. He fell silent for a moment, and his little eyes darted suspicious glances from side to side before he proceeded.","2001": "That night there was the sound of uproarious singing, which was followed by what sounded like a violent quarrel and ended at about eleven o'clock with a tremendous crash of glass. No one stirred in the farmhouse before noon on the following day, and the word went round that from somewhere or other the pigs had acquired the money to buy themselves another case of whisky.","2002": "Clover was an old stout mare now, stiff in the joints and with a tendency to rheumy eyes.","2003": "They accepted everything that they were told about the Rebellion and the principles of Animalism, especially from Clover, for whom they had an almost filial respect; but it was doubtful whether they understood much of it.","2004": "But still, neither pigs nor dogs produced any food by their own labour; and there were very many of them, and their appetites were always good.","2005": "After that it did not seem strange when next day the pigs who were supervising the work of the farm all carried whips in their trotters.","2006": "The animals were weeding the turnip field. They worked diligently, hardly raising their faces from the ground, and not knowing whether to be more frightened of the pigs or of the human visitors.","2007": "And suddenly, at the sound of the mingled voices, the animals were stricken with curiosity. What could be happening in there, now that for the first time animals and human beings were meeting on terms of equality?","2008": "He would end his remarks, he said, by emphasising once again the friendly feelings that subsisted, and ought to subsist, between Animal Farm and its neighbours.","2009": "After much choking, during which his various chins turned purple, he managed to get out: 'If you have your lower animals to contend with,' he said, 'we have our lower classes!' This bon mot set the table in a roar; and Mr Pilkington once again congratulated the pigs on the low rations, the long working-hours and the general absence of pampering which he had observed on Animal Farm.","2010": "Their sole wish, now and in the past, was to live at peace and in normal business relations with their neighbours.","2011": "There had also been a very strange custom, whose origin was unknown, of marching every Sunday morning past a boar's skull which was nailed to a post in the garden.","2012": "I will give you the same toast as before, but in a different form. Fill your glasses to the brim. Gentlemen, here is my toast: To the prosperity of The Manor Farm!","2013": "There were shoutings, bangings on the table, sharp suspicious glances, furious denials. The source of the trouble appeared to be that Napoleon and Mr. Pilkington had each played an ace of spades simultaneously.","2014": "Twelve voices were shouting in anger, and they were all alike. No question, now, what had happened to the faces of the pigs. The creatures outside looked from pig to man, and from man to pig, and from pig to man again: but already it was impossible to say which was which.","2015": "Es gibt sechs Wochen voller Sommerferientage, bis die Schule beginnt und es ernst wird.

I underestimated how difficult it actually is to unlearn your muscle memory.

First, know the locations of the keys by memory. I'm talking about not looking at your keyboard or any other reference image while you're typing. You should be able to remember the general location of every key after a moment of thought. Second, know the locations of the keys without having to think about it. This means committing the locations of the keys to muscle memory. You shouldn't have to actively think about where any of the letters are - your fingers should know where to go automatically.","2093": "I was getting ten words per minute faster every single day, up until the fifty to sixty threshold.

It didn't even take a second to adjust.","2094": "I continued getting better every day - after two weeks, I got my first 100 words per minute score. After a month, my first average of a hundred. I was feeling good: my improvement was consistent, and at this rate, I'd be catching up to my QWERTY speed soon. But improving at typing is not a linear process: even though I was getting better every day, after you reach a certain skill level, your improvement rate starts to slow down, just like any other skill. And that reality started to hit me.","2095": "Breaking plateaus in anything is a difficult task. Sometimes, a new practice method can help you push through it, and other times, it's just more and more focused practice.

It may pay off in unmet eyes or a curious state, surly dismissals or a question, dialogue or bruises.","2204": "Use why-how laddering to flesh out varying user needs and find a middle ground that's both meaningful and actionable. As a general rule, asking \"why\" yields abstract statements and asking \"how\" yields specific statements. Often times abstract statements are more meaningful, but not as actionable. The opposite is true of more specific statements.","2205": "The hard part is selecting which ideas to act on. Brainstorm selection may be straight forward for some brainstorms, but selecting design solutions may take more deliberation. Don't pick just one and don't settle on safe choices. Select a range of ideas to carry forward into prototyping, aiming to preserve the breadth of solutions generated by the group.","2206": "It's a bit counterintuitive, yet imposing constraints (with intention) can actually increase creative potential. Think of as many silver things as you can in ten seconds. Now think of silver things in your kitchen. Which prompt sparked more ideas?","2207": "Rather than prototype a complete mockup of a solution, it's more productive to single out and test a specific variable. Identifying a variable not only saves time and money, it gives you the opportunity to test multiple prototypes, each varying in one property. This encourages the user to make nuanced comparisons between prototypes and choose one option over another.","2208": "When teams struggle to innovate it's often because they neglect to look outside their organization for inspiration. Unlike competitive research, analogies push teams to consider radically different industries and offerings to apply a fresh perspective on a familiar challenge.","2209": "A wizard of Oz prototype fakes functionality that you want to test with users, saving you the time and money of actually creating it. Wizard of Oz prototypes often refer to prototypes of digital systems, in which the user thinks the response is computer-driven, when in fact it's human-controlled.","2210": "During the design process, it can be unclear how to proceed forward, particularly when team members have mixed opinions. The best way to resolve team conflicts about design elements is to prototype and evaluate them with users. If a prototype is received well, it's a good sign it's worth pursuing further.","2211": "So many questions, but I'm talking to myself; I know that you can't hear me anymore. So much to tell you, and most of all, goodbye, but I know that you can't hear me anymore. The longer I stand here, the louder the silence. I know that you're gone, but sometimes I swear that I hear your voice when the wind blows; so I talk to the shadows, hoping you might be listening 'cause I want you to know: \"It's so loud inside my head, with words that I should've said, and as I drown in my regrets, I can't take back the words I never said.\"","2212": "Your body does not eliminate poisons by knowing their names. To try to control fear or depression or boredom by calling them names is to resort to superstition of trust in curses and invocations. It is so easy to see why this does not work. Obviously, we try to know, name, and define fear in order to make it \"objective,\" that is, separate from \"I.\"","2213": "I can hear you far away. I can see you in the distance. I am living for today; I go forth with no resistance. You're the castle in the skies. I'm an island on the ocean. Will we make it through the night - if we're guided by devotion? If we drift to the horizon; if we let it all go, then will you come with me - til' we are free? If we drift to the horizon and if we let it all go, then will you come with me? I'm gonna make it somehow; I'm gonna break through the clouds. I will make you mine. I'm gonna sing it out loud; I'm gonna drown in the sun. Will you leave me a sign?","2214": "Lily was a little girl afraid of the big, wide world. She grew up within her castle walls. Now and then she tried to run, and then on the night with the setting sun, she went in the woods away so afraid, all alone.","2215": "It told her, \"don't you worry, just follow everywhere I go: top of all the mountains or valley low. I'll give you everything you've been dreaming of, just let me in. Everything you want in gold, I'll be the magic story you've been told, and you'll be safe under my control; just let me in.\"","2216": "If I had a diamond heart - oh-oh - I'd give you all my love if I was unbreakable. If I had a diamond heart - oh-oh - you could shoot me with a gun of gold. And if I was unbreakable, I'd walk straight through the bullet, bendin' like a tulip, blue-eyed and foolish - never mind the bruises - into the fire, breakin' through the wires; and give you all I've got. (If I had a diamond heart,) I'd walk straight through the dagger; never break the pattern: diamonds don't shatter, beautiful and battered; into the poison, cry you an ocean, and give you all I've got.","2217": "Listen to me, Woodrow. When a soldier goes into war he must go believing he is never coming back. This is why the Japanese are such courageous warriors. They are prepared to die. They expect nothing else. But to do that, you must believe in what you're fighting for. If you are not willing to die, you won't fight well. And if you don't fight well you will probably be killed stupidly, for the wrong reason, and unheroically.","2218": "I had seen him cry a few times before. It only happened when he was singing or when someone else sang a song that moved him. He played the three-string shamisen, which Kiyo and I called his \"pinko-pinko.\" We would laugh together when we heard him plucking it and whining out Japanese melodies. We would hold our ears and giggle. It was always a great joke between us, except for those rare times when Papa began to weep at the lyrics. Then we would just stare quietly - as I did that night - from some hidden corner of the room. This was always mysterious and incomprehensible.","2219": "The door of the mess hall flew open and a short, beefy man came tearing out. He jumped off the porch, running as his feet hit the ground. He didn't get far. Papa came through the doorway right behind him, in a flying leap, bellowing like a warrior, \"Yaaaaaah!\"","2220": "It can be a hearty or plaintive tune, depending on your mood. From Papa, that night, it was a deep-throated lament. Almost invisible in the stove's small glow, tears began running down his face.","2221": "While recruiting for this unit and speeding up the relocation program, the government figured it could simultaneously weed out the \"disloyal\" and thus get a clearer idea of exactly how many agents and Japanese sympathizers it actually had to deal with. The part of it would have been comical if the results were not so grotesque. No self-respecting espionage agent would willingly admit he was disloyal.","2222": "I have been living in this country nine years longer than you have. Do you realize that? Yet I am prevented by law from becoming a citizen. I am prevented by law from owning land. I am now separated from my family without cause...","2223": "He wasn't even a very successful man. He was a poser, a braggart, and a tyrant. But he had held onto his self-respect, he dreamed grand dreams, and he could work well at any task he turned his hand to: he could raise vegetables, sail a boat, plead a case in small claims court, sing Japanese poems, make false teeth, and carve a pig.","2224": "As previously mentioned, I had a tendency for tardiness, and was therefore rushing up the stairs of the school building. At that moment, a girl fell from the sky...","2225": "How long I've waited to see that day - everyday, but a moment away; In Heaven where all my dreams come true, I live to see my dream come true.","2226": "They seem like flowers, yet, they will continue to bloom - even as the earth withers away.","2227": "Before I died that day, was it Heaven that I saw or could it have been Hell?","2228": "He brought back chunks of driftwood, and he would pass long hours sitting on the steps carving myrtle limbs into benches, table legs, and lamps, filling our rooms with bits of gnarled, polished furniture.","2229": "When things aren't working out for people, the end of the world seems like an easy way to wipe the slate clean.","2230": "Flowers always make people better, happier, and more helpful; they are sunshine, food and medicine for the soul.","2231": "You're only here for a short visit. Don't hurry, don't worry. And be sure to smell the flowers along the way.","2232": "A flower blooming in the desert proves to the world that adversity, no matter how great, can be overcome.","2233": "Gardens and flowers have a way of bringing people together, drawing them from their homes.","2234": "Alright, close your eyes. I want you to think of a flower. Look at its contours, its curves. Now I want you to imagine it: changing, moving backwards, returning to its bud. Think of that bud, unopened. Look at it, as a whole, and silently repeat these phrases: \"May you be free from suffering. May you be free from fear. May you know peace and joy.\"","2235": "There is nothing like looking, if you want to find something. You certainly usually find something, if you look, but it is not always quite the something you were after.","2236": "My mother, she brought a smile to my face every day. In a life so ordinary and full of struggles for being poor, it was her that was extraordinary. As nature turns seed and water to flower, mother turned the normal things into fascination and love; she was my happiness, my hero. Still, for some reason, I feel empty now.","2237": "Maybe I made a mistake yesterday, but yesterday's me is still me. I am who I am today, with all my faults. Tomorrow I might be a tiny bit wiser, and that's me, too. These faults and mistakes are what I am, making up the brightest stars in the constellation of my life. I have come to love myself for who I was, who I am, and who I hope to become.","2238": "Tell me your story. I want to hear your voice, and I want to hear your conviction. No matter who you are, where you're from, your skin colour, gender identity: speak yourself.","2239": "After showing us the first three ballet positions she sat down to rest. She took her shoes off. Her toes were showing blood. I noticed then the lines in her face, the traces of gray in her black hair. I felt so sorry for her I decided to go ahead and sign up for her course. But once I left that room, back out into the dust, wind-flurried afternoon, I never did return. Ballet seemed then some terrible misuse of the body.","2240": "White stones border the path. Two dogs are following an old woman in gardening clothes as she strolls along. She is in the middle distance, small beneath the trees, beneath the snowy peaks. It is winter. All the elms are bare. The scene is both stark and comforting. This path leads toward one edge of the camp, but the wire is out of sight, or out of focus. The tiny woman very much seems at ease. She and her tiny dogs seemed swallowed by the landscape, or floating in it.","2241": "Gossip tends to thrive on bad news, not good. Stories such as these spread through the camp and grew in our minds like tumors.","2242": "But they all knew, even as they said it, that Papa would never move back east. As bad as the West Coast sounded, it was still his home territory. He was too old to start over, too afraid of rejection in an unknown part of the world, too stubborn and too tired to travel that far, and too proud to do piecework on an assembly line.","2243": "His brain took him back to a time when he was very little, all bundled up in a snowsuit. He and his mother were walking, hand in hand, mitten in mitten, when they both slipped on some ice and fell and rolled down a snow-covered hillside. They ended up at the bottom of the hill. He remembered he almost cried, but instead he laughed. His mother laughed, too.","2244": "Just off the road, you spot a man furiously boring into the earth. As you approach, he silently beams a smile, hands you a shovel, and, before you realize what's happening, you too are digging holes.","2245": "His fingers worked below her shoulder blades. He had found the knot, the tension node, and he homed in on it with a practiced knuckle. Mama rolled her head from side to side, pulling at the tendons in her neck, groaning loudly now, hissing with painful pleasure of his cure.","2246": "A gust of wind rushed through the orchard, bringing ice off the white slopes, and more blossom scent. It hurt to inhale deeply. I pulled my coat tight, ready to head for the car's warmth, but also wanting to hold this moment for a little longer. I might never be back here again.","2247": "The young kids were mystified by this and stood open-eyed, watching. Some older folks smiled, waving as we hit a chuckhole and bounced. Papa swung left, and we clattered out onto the wide, empty boulevard that ran the length of the camp, back to where our own baggage waited and the final packing.","2248": "And if a beachhead of cooperation may push back the jungle of suspicion, let both sides join in creating a new endeavor, not a new balance of power, but a new world of law, where the strong are just and the weak secure and the peace preserved.","2249": "Let both sides seek to invoke the wonders of science instead of its terrors. Together let us explore the stars, conquer the deserts, eradicate disease, tap the ocean depths and encourage the arts and commerce.","2250": "So let us begin anew - remembering on both sides that civility is not a sign of weakness, and sincerity is always subject to proof. Let us never negotiate out of fear. But let us never fear to negotiate.","2251": "In the long history of the world, only a few generations have been granted the role of defending freedom in its hour of maximum danger. I do not shrink from this responsibility - I welcome it. I do not believe that any of us would exchange places with any other people or any other generation. The energy, the faith, the devotion which we bring to this endeavor will light our country and all who serve it - and the flow from that fire can truly light the world.","2252": "During an SCP-001 event, flowers are observed to spontaneously appear and bloom over 90% of the viable land surface of the planet. These flowers are universally referred to as \"vibrant\", \"bright\", \"beautiful\", and/or words to this effect. The weather will clear, globally, with an ambient temperature recognised as comfortable by the majority of the populace. The global populace will become aware of the fate of the Earth, and of its inevitability. They will also experience heavily decreased levels of violence. SCP-001 will occur exactly 24 hours before the death of all life on the planet.","2253": "From that time on, the world was hers for the reading. She would never be lonely again, never miss the lack of intimate friends.","2254": "Eggman, I am going to save this planet, and I am going to free these aliens! No copyright law in the universe is going to stop me! We can save a lot of time and broken robots if you just quit now!","2255": "All my life I've been playing with fire. Set me free: that's my only desire. The time has come for me: the time to overcome and do what is right for the world to see - and from the ashes of the dawn I arise.","2256": "I used to rule the world: seas would rise when I gave the word. Now in the morning, I sleep alone - sweep the streets I used to own. I used to roll the dice - feel the fear in my enemy's eyes. Listen as the crowd would sing, \"Now the old King is dead, long live the King.\" One minute I held the key; next the walls were closed on me - and I discovered that my castles stand upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand.","2257": "It was a wicked and wild wind: blew down the doors to let me in. Shattered windows and the sounds of drums - people couldn't believe what I'd become: just a puppet on a lonely string. Oh, who would ever want to be King! I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing; Roman Cavalry choirs are singing. Be my mirror, my sword, my shield - my missionaries in a foreign field. For some reason I can't explain, once you'd gone, there was never, never an honest word - and that was when I ruled the world.","2258": "Foolishness, Dante. Foolishness. Might controls everything.

Let's settle this... Dante.","2260": "The psychology department actually studies the limits of almost all psychology. And it's only when you go to graduate school that you can do some real research. In graduate school, after deciding on a specific major and an academic adviser and applying, you have to pass an interview and written evaluation of your research plans.","2261": "It happened during the procession at a parish church in Ontario, Canada. As the choir moved in perfect unison to the hymn, the last young lady slipped her stiletto heel into the grating over a hot air duct in the center of the aisle. The first man following her noticed the situation, and without skipping a beat, reached down and swooped up the shoe. The entire grating came with it. Startled, but still singing, the man marched on, carrying in his hand the shoe with the grating attached. There was never a break in the procession and right in time to the beat, the next man fell into the open duct.","2262": "The little organ wheezed and gasped for breath, the young organist pumping the pedals furiously trying to keep the beat and the hymn alive.","2263": "This church had no walls, no ceiling, no altar, no stained glass windows. Granite outcroppings and boulders served as walls; tall pines were the support beams. The ceiling was the deep blue sky that canopied the highest ridge, the tallest tree. Instead of richly colored stained glass windows, we looked out on pine-covered ridges mounting one after another, each one higher, as if to touch the still hidden snowcaps we knew to be just beyond our line of vision.","2264": "To this day, I cannot sing those old familiar hymns without bringing all my senses into play. Somewhere I hear the wheezing, gasping sounds of that decrepit organ. I conjure up the fragrance of Ponderosa pine. I feel the mountain wind stirring my hair. And in my mind's eye I see the faces of the friends of my youth. The memories from a mere 30 Sundays, spread over six summers out of a lifetime, reach across the years and are as vivid to me now as the last time I worshiped on that hill far away.","2265": "But I wish that just once more I could sit in a straight-backed wicker chair on that platform on the side of a hill in Colorado. I wish that just once more I could look up at the ridges, breathe in the fragrance of the pines, hear the gasping notes from that old pump organ and see the faces of the friends of my youth. I wish just once more, I could sing - on that hill far away.","2266": "The choir struggled to stay with the caprices of the instrument that occasionally seemed to take on a personality all its own - rather like a horse from the camp stables taking the bit in its teeth and running off.","2267": "Vision? What do you know about my vision? My vision would turn your world upside down, tear asunder your illusions, and send the sanctuary of your own ignorance crashing down around you. Now ask yourself, are you ready to see that vision?","2268": "Even in a book of lies sometimes you find truth. There is indeed a season for all things and now that I see you flesh-to-flesh and blood-to-blood I know I cannot raise my hand against you. But know this, you are my greatest disappointment. Does your master hear me? Atlas! You can kill me, but you will never have my city. My strength is not in steel and fire, that is what the parasites will never understand. A season for all things! A time to live and a time to die, a time to build... and a time to destroy!","2269": "My planet, Arrakis, is so beautiful when the sun is low. Rolling over the sands, you can see spice in the air.","2270": "Extreme temperatures and treacherous weather events make life outside the cities of Arrakis truly hostile. With sandstorms powerful enough to cut through the metal, only the native tribes known as the Fremen have adapted well enough to survive.","2271": "Long exposure to spice has given the tribe their characteristic blue eyes, the eyes of Ibad. Little else is known of the Fremen, except that they are dangerous and unreliable. Fremen attack make spice harvesting extremely hazardous.","2272": "Political danger. The great houses look to us for leadership and this threatens the Emperor. By taking Arrakis from the Harkonnens and making it ours he sets the stage for a war which would weaken both houses. But if we hold firm and tap the true power of Arrakis we could be stronger than ever.","2273": "For 80 years Arrakis belonged to House Harkonnen. Eighty years of owning the spice fields. Can you imagine the wealth? In your eyes, I need to see it in your eyes. You never met Harkonners before. I have. They are not human. They're brutal! You have to be ready.","2274": "Like sifting sand through a screen, we sift people. If you had been unable to control your impulses like an animal, we could not have let you live. You inherit too much power.","2275": "There's a space port, and in that plump of dust there's a spice refinery: our two most vulnerable points. I want you guarding them.","2276": "The history book, which he propped against the catsup and the glass sugar bowl, had been used by others before him. Blank pages front and back were filled in with maps, drawings, dates, comic cartoons, and organs of the body; also with names and messages no longer clear and never absolutely legible. On nearly every other page there was some marginal notation, either in ink or in very hard pencil. And unless someone had upset a glass of water, the marks on page 177 were from tears.","2277": "Time is probably no more unkind to sporting characters than it is to other people, but physical decay unsustained by respectability is somehow more noticeable. Mr. Peters' hair was turning gray and his scalp showed through on top. He had lost weight also; he no longer filled out his clothes the way he used to. His color was poor, and the flower had disappeared from his buttonhole. In its place was an American Legion button.","2278": "Mr. Peters straightened his tie self-consciously and when Irma handed him a menu, he gestured with it so that the two women at the next table would notice the diamond ring on the fourth finger of his right hand. Both of these things, and also the fact that his hands showed signs of the manicurist, one can blame on the young man who had his picture taken with a derby hat on the back of his head. The young man had never for one second deserted Mr. Peters. He was always there, tugging at Mr. Peters' elbow, making him do things that were not becoming of a man of forty-five.","2279": "Human beings have rights, because they are moral beings: the rights of all men grow out of their moral nature; and as all men have the same moral nature, they have essentially the same rights.","2280": "Now if rights are founded in the nature of our moral being, then the mere circumstance of sex does not give to man higher rights and responsibilities, than to woman. To suppose that it does, would be to deny the self-evident truth, that the \"physical constitution is the mere instrument of the moral nature.\"","2281": "The bottom line? Today's organic farming practices are probably best deployed in fruit and vegetable farms, where growing nutrition (not just bulk calories) is the primary goal. But for delivering sheer calories, especially in our staple crops of wheat, rice, maize, soybeans and so on, conventional farms have the advantage right now.","2282": "According to one theory, the wisdom of the crowd still holds - measuring the aggregate of people's opinions produces a stable, reliable value. Skeptics, however, argue that people's opinions are easily swayed by those of others. So nudging a crowd early on by presenting contrary opinions - for example, exposing them to some very good or very bad attitudes - will steer the crowd in a different direction.","2283": "Some of the largest ocean waves in the world are nearly impossible to see. Unlike other large waves, these rollers, called internal waves, do not ride the ocean surface.

Where do all the broken-hearted songs stop singing and resign themselves to fate? Why did you go, though we were running freely through open meadows of fire and waterfalls?

And... watching it... her smile begins to gradually recede. The look in her eyes grows colder, her breathing slows, and the faint glimmer of excitement provided by this cataclysmic view is snuffed out, replaced with objectivity. Her opinion on the disaster destroying all is delivered in a single word. With a little appreciation, in a mostly hollow tone, she says, \"Delightful.\" As if the word has any meaning. As if the fall has any meaning. As if the world has any meaning.","2299": "And now, instincts begin to lurch, old and forgotten, in the wake of those thoughts.

But the only option they really have is to trust us.","2311": "Hearing this unexpected noise caused me to shoot up and spill my water, which was also a surprise because I didn't remember I was holding a cup of water, so it seemed like maybe I was being attacked.","2312": "But because of the tumors and the fact that my blood tested positive for something related to cancer, they'd told me it was anywhere from maybe cancer to probably cancer.","2313": "I am the storm that is approaching, provoking, black clouds in isolation; I am the reclaimer of my name, born in flames, I have been blessed; my family crest is a demon of death!","2314": "Whether you are running on a treadmill or doing a set of push-ups, get to the point where you are so tired and in pain that your mind is begging you to stop. Then push just 5 to 10 percent further.","2315": "This cosmic dance of bursting decadence and withheld permissions twists all our arms collectively, but if sweetness can win, and it can, then I'll still be here tomorrow to high-five you yesterday, my friend. Peace.","2316": "Recall is retrieving information that is not currently in your conscious awareness but that was learned at an earlier time. A fill-in-the-blank question tests your recall.","2317": "Recognition is identifying items previously learned. A multiple-choice question tests your recognition.","2318": "Relearning is learning something more quickly when you learn it a second or later time. When you study for a final exam or engage a language used in early childhood, you will relearn the material more easily than you did initially.","2319": "Our agile brain processes many things simultaneously by means of parallel processing. To focus on this multitrack processing, one information-processing model, connectionism, views memories as products of interconnected neural networks. Specific memories arise from particular activation patterns within these networks. Every time you learn something new, your brain's neural connections change, forming and strengthening pathways that allow you to interact with and learn from your constantly changing environment.","2320": "We first record to-be-remembered information as a fleeting sensory memory. From there, we process information into short-term memory, where we encode it through rehearsal. Finally, information moves into long-term memory for later retrieval.","2321": "Sleep supports memory consolidation. In one experiment, students who learned material in a study/sleep/restudy condition remembered material better both a week and six months later than those who studied in the morning and restudied in the evening without intervening sleep.","2322": "The cerebellum plays a key role in forming and storing the implicit memories created by classical conditioning. With a damaged cerebellum, people cannot develop certain reflexes, such as associating a tone with an impending puff of air.","2323": "That's all well and good. But listen, people who know what pain is are kinder to others because of it. That's not the same thing as being weak.","2324": "Make your choice, adventurous stranger; strike the bell and bide the danger. Or wonder, 'till it drives you mad, what would have followed if you had.","2325": "She came in and she was like a shot of espresso. She's like being bathed in sunlight. She's incredibly energetic and enthusiastic. And she had this sense of play and fun which was incredibly exciting.","2326": "Whether we write or speak or do but look, we are ever unapparent. What we are cannot be transfused into word or book. Our soul from us is infinitely far.","2327": "Changes that seem small and unimportant at first will compound into remarkable results if you're willing to stick with them for years. We all deal with setbacks but in the long run, the quality of our lives often depends on the quality of our habits.","2328": "Maybe there are people who can achieve incredible success overnight but I don't know any of them. It is a gradual evolution, a long series of small wins and tiny breakthroughs. The only way we make progress is to start small.","2329": "The entrepreneur and investor Naval Ravikant has said, \"To write a great book, you must first become the book.\"","2330": "It is so easy to overestimate the importance of one defining moment and underestimate the value of making small improvements on a daily basis. Too often, we convince ourselves that massive success requires massive action but it's simply not true.","2331": "Meanwhile, improving by one percent isn't particularly notable - sometimes it isn't even noticeable - but it can be far more meaningful, especially in the long run. The difference a tiny improvement can make over time is astounding.","2332": "If you can get 1% better each day for one year, you'll end up 37 times better by the time you're done. Conversely, if you get 1% worse each day for one year, you'll decline nearly down to zero. What starts as a small win or a minor setback accumulates into something much more.","2333": "Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement. The same way that money multiplies through compound interest, the effects of your habits multiply as you repeat them.","2334": "Breakthrough moments are often the result of many previous actions, which build up the potential required to unleash a major change. For example, bamboo can barely be seen for the first five years as it builds extensive root systems underground before exploding 90 feet into the air within six weeks.","2335": "In the early and middle stages of any quest, there is often a Valley of Disappointment. You expect to make progress in a linear fashion and it's frustrating how ineffective changes can seem during first days, weeks, and even months. It doesn't feel like you are going anywhere. It's a hallmark of any compounding process: the most powerful outcomes are delayed.","2336": "You think, \"I've been running every day for a month, so why can't I see any change in my body?\" Once this kind of thinking takes over, it's easy to let good habits fall by the wayside. But in order to make a meaningful difference, habits need to persist long enough to break through this plateau.","2337": "The goal in any sport is to finish with the best score, but it would be ridiculous to spend the whole game staring at the scoreboard. The only way to actually win is to get better each day.","2338": "Imagine you have a messy room and you set a goal to clean it. If you summon the energy to tidy up, then you will have a clean room - for now. But if you maintain the same sloppy, pack-rat habits that led to a messy room in the first place, soon you'll be looking at a new pile of clutter and hoping for another burst of motivation.","2339": "The Hunters who had arrived early sipped on the cups of coffee handed out by the Association's employee and shared cordial greetings with each other.","2340": "His wife was deeply worried about him since this would be his first raid in quite a while. Honestly, even he himself was worried, too. However, now that he listened to Kim's words, he felt like a weight was lifted off his mind.","2341": "I'm not trying to get you to apologise, you know? I'm only worried about you. If you continue fighting this way, sooner or later you'll be faced with a truly dangerous situation.","2342": "The interior of the hidden, cave-like passage was dark and nothing could be seen. Mister Song activated his specialty, flame magic, and tossed it further forward into the passage.","2343": "The flame flew forward and illuminated the interior. The passageway seemed to go on forever. Soon enough, the flame lost its forward momentum, fell to the ground and smouldered for a bit before flickering out of existence.","2344": "Now normally, we're supposed to relay this information back to the Association and wait for their decision first, but... But, if we do that, we might end up handing over the task of killing the boss to other Hunters, and our takings for today's raid would decrease by a lot.","2345": "The truth was, no one here could figure out the current situation and so, their safety could not be guaranteed. However, the difficulty of this particular dungeon proved to be very low.","2346": "Treasures or rare loot found in a dungeon would normally be divided equally among all the participants in a raid. It was quite a different way of sharing the rewards where one could take possession of magic crystals one procured by themselves.","2347": "There must've been some sort of mechanism installed on the heavy-looking door, since the physical strength of a 67-year-old man was enough to easily open it.","2348": "As soon as Hunters sat foot inside, flames erupted on the numerous torches packed tightly on the walls all at the same time. Thanks to that, the interior brightened up considerably.","2349": "In the deepest part of the dome, something so logic-defyingly humongous sat on a throne just as big as itself. It was none other than a huge stone statue of a god!","2350": "The chamber of the stone god statue might have been massive, yet its actual inner structure was on the simpler side. On the walls, countless torches could be found there. And in front of these walls, more stone statues, slightly taller than a human being, stood tall and unmoving. There were lots of them here as well, found at a certain distance from one another.","2351": "In a village of La Mancha, the name of which I have no desire to call mine, there lived not long since one of those gentlemen that keep a lance in the lance-rack, an old buckler, a lean hack, and a greyhound for coursing.","2352": "We lost ourselves. Lost our dream. In the pursuit of great, we failed to do good.","2353": "I'm in a foreign state; my thoughts, they slip away. My words are leaving me; they caught an aeroplane because I thought of you - just for the thought of you. Oh lights go down! In the moment, we're lost and found. I just wanna be by your side. If these wings could fly! Oh, curse these walls. In the moment, we're ten feet tall; and how you told me after it all, we'd remember tonight - for the rest of our lives. If these wings could fly...","2354": "As said, that is why she walks: to find this god. And so, she faces it: the world of black. The Void.","2355": "She witnesses her empty palm. She glances at Charon, who, as ever, says nothing. ...But she sets her shoulders. ...She is the master, after all. She looks at her staring servant, and asks... \"...Shall we go and see the end?\"","2356": "I marched ahead into the dark because I wanted to find a better truth. However, the truth is as bitter and merciless as I'd always assumed. I've been in this state for too long to count. I have lost the minutes and hours. And every so often I will see it again: Light - true light - in the distance. Perhaps it has been guiding me. I wouldn't admit this, to anyone. It's like a loss: relinquishing myself to what I've long criticized. However, I feel it for certain: that light is now beckoning me. That light of the old world is shining, and wants me. And in that light, I find deliverance...","2357": "I think I'm going to return. If I do, I don't believe I will take the truth with me. I will not forget it, but I will surely leave it behind. I believe it, don't I? I could do the job better than that god. But, I will need hands again for it first. I shouldn't simply think or talk that I might be better. I'll do it. I will. But really... I am not swelling with pride as I escape here. Instead, take this as revenge. I'll change the world, or craft a better one. You've left this one broken so badly. Isn't anything possible? I think so. No... I know it.","2358": "According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly. Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway, because bees don't care what humans think is impossible.","2359": "Abuela. I can finally see. You lost your home. Lost everything. You suffered so much, all alone, so it would never happen again. We were saved because of you. We were given a miracle, because of you. We are a family because of you. And nothing could ever be broken that we can't fix... together. I asked my Pedro for help. Mirabel. He sent me you.","2360": "Tomorrow would be a big day, he knew. He knew it all too well, in fact. Tomorrow would be the biggest day in his life, because tomorrow was the Choosing Day and it would determine how he spent the rest of his life.","2361": "All I want to do is sleep all day because sometimes, in my dreams, you're still here.","2362": "What happened to you? \"I'm not sure. I tried to buy some tacos and wound up getting paid twenty dollars to swim in a vat of Mountain Dew.\"","2363": "Sometimes, I find myself lying awake at 4AM. I am suddenly filled with ambition and excitement, thinking about all the things I'm going to be too tired to do when I get up.","2364": "Sweetie, there's no monster in your closet! Look, it's just your clothes and toys. Make sure you stay tucked in bed. It could be anywhere by now.","2365": "What's your Wi-Fi password here? \"There is no password.\" Oh cool, so - \"All one word.\" Wait - \"With underscores between each word.\"","2366": "Finally! I'm an adult! I can do things I was never allowed to do as a kid like eat ice cream for every meal! My brain has absorbed heaps and reams of knowledge! Like the reasons why I shouldn't eat ice cream for every meal.","2367": "Okay, our top-selling microwave oven is in need of some new features. Any ideas? \"You know how it has a built-in clock? What if when it's between midnight and six AM all the beeps are three times as loud?\" ... That's fantastic. People will love that.","2368": "The pact is sealed! I shall destroy Billy Westlake for his insulting words about your mother! \"No. I wish for him to stub his toe, and the day before it finally heals, he will stub it again. Over and over. Forever.\" ... Dang kid, I gotta write this one down.","2369": "Alive without breath; as cold as death; never thirsting, ever drinking; clad in mail, never clinking. Drowns on dry land, thinks an island is a mountain; thinks a fountain is a puff of air. So sleek, so fair! What a joy to meet! We only wish to catch a fish, so juicy-sweet!","2370": "Everything that lives is designed to end. We are perpetually trapped in a never-ending spiral of life and death. Is this a curse? Or some kind of punishment? I often think about the god who blessed us with this cryptic puzzle... and wonder if we'll ever get the chance to kill him.","2371": "The rules are simple: they lie to us, we know they're lying, they know we know they're lying, but they keep lying to us, and we keep pretending to believe them.","2372": "Suddenly he stopped. There was an answer, or so he thought; but it seemed to come from behind him, away down the path further back in the Forest. He turned round and listened, and soon there could be no doubt; someone was singing a song; a deep glad voice was singing carelessly and happily, but it was singing nonsense.","2373": "Supernovae can expel several solar masses of material at speeds up to several percent of the speed of light. This drives expanding shock wave into the surrounding interstellar medium, sweeping up an expanding shell of gas and dust observed as a supernova remnant.","2374": "Type 1a supernovae are thought to be potentially the most dangerous if they occur close enough to the Earth. Because these supernovae arise from dim, common white dwarf stars in binary systems, it is likely that a supernova that can affect the Earth will occur unpredictably and in a star system that is not well studied.","2375": "They stood on the porches and tried to believe in the existence of Earth, much as they had once tried to believe in the existence of Mars; it was a problem reversed. But now, tonight, the dead were risen, Earth was reinhabited, memory awoke, a million names were spoken: What was so-and-so doing tonight on Earth? What about this one and that one? The people on the porches glanced sidewise at each other's faces. At nine o'clock Earth seemed to explode, catch fire, and burn. The people on the porches put up their hands as if to beat the fire out. They waited.","2376": "I hate being clever, thought the captain, when you don't really feel clever and don't want to be clever. To sneak around and make plans and feel big about making them. I hate this feeling of thinking I'm doing right when I'm not really certain I am.","2377": "Who are we, anyway? The majority? Is that the answer? The majority is always holy, is it now? Always, always; just never wrong for one little insignificant tiny moment, is it? Never ever wrong in ten million years? He thought: What is this majority and who are in it? And what do they think and how did they get that way and will they ever change and how the devil did I get caught in this rotten majority?","2378": "Will I be clean after this? he thought. Is it right that it's me who does it? Yes, it is. I know what I'm doing for what reason and it's right, because I think I'm the right person. I hope and pray I can live up to this.","2379": "\"Come on,\" he said. \"We've got to get the place fixed! All the hot dogs boiling, the buns warm, the chili cooking, the onions peeled and diced, the relish laid out, the napkins in the dips, the place spotless! Hey!\" He did a little wild dance, kicking his heels. \"Oh boy, I'm happy; yes sir, I'm happy,\" he sang off key. \"This is my lucky day!\"","2380": "\"Send me your hungry, old Earth. Here's Sam Parkhill, his hot dogs all boiled, his chili cooking, everything neat as a pin. Come on, you Earth, send me your rocket!\" \"It sure makes you humble,\" he said among the cooking odors of wieners, warm buns, rich butter. \"Step up,\" he invited the various stars in the sky. \"Who'll be the first to buy?\"","2381": "Earth changed in the black sky. It caught fire. Part of it seemed to come apart in a million pieces, as if a gigantic jigsaw puzzle had exploded. It had burned with an unholy dripping glare for a minute, three times normal size, then dwindled.","2382": "Night after night for every year and every year, for no reason at all, the woman comes out and looks at the sky, her hands up, for a long moment, looking at the green burning of Earth, not knowing why she looks, and then she goes back and throws a stick on the fire, and the wind comes up and the dead sea goes on being dead.","2383": "A silver ring fish floated by them, undulating, and closing like an iris, instantly, around food particles, to assimilate them. Dad looked at it. His voice was deep and quiet. \"Just like war. War swims along, sees food, contracts. A moment later - Earth is gone.\"","2384": "There will come soft rains and the smell of the ground, and swallows with their shimmering sound; And frogs in the pools singing at night, and wild plum trees in tremulous white; Robins will wear their feathery fire, whistling their whims on a low fence-wire; And not one will know of the war, not one will care at last when it is done. Not one would mind, neither bird nor tree, if mankind perished utterly; And Spring herself, when she woke at dawn would scarcely know that we were gone.","2385": "Dimitri said something in Russian to them. They said something back. He said some other thing and pointed to me. They smiled and made happy Russian sounds.","2386": "Well, after all, this is the age of the disposable tissue. Blow your nose on a person, wad them, flush them away, reach for another, blow, wad, flush.","2387": "The black land slid by and he was going into the country among the hills: For the first time in a dozen years the stars were coming out above him, in great processions of wheeling fire. He saw a great juggernaut of stars form in the sky and threaten to roll over and crush him.","2388": "As the harbor shrinks, growing fainter in the distance, severing you forever from this strange, newly formed nation called the United States, you haven't the slightest idea after years of war which of these names fits, or what the future holds, though on one matter you are clear: From the start, you were fighting for no one but yourself.","2389": "I need you more than you know, more than you'd believe. You're the only thing that really makes me want to live. There are times when I feel like I have no will to fight. You always come and chase the demons from my mind. You're beautiful inside and out, and I wish to thank you, for you're the one who made me want to stay.","2390": "The best way to measure how much you've grown isn't by inches or the number of laps you can now run around the track, or even your grade point average-- though those things are important, to be sure. It's what you've done with your time, how you've chosen to spend your days, and whom you've touched this year. That, to me, is the greatest measure of success.","2391": "I think there should be a rule that everyone in the world should get a standing ovation at least once in their lives.","2392": "And so with the sunshine and the great bursts of leaves growing on the trees, just as things grow in fast movies, I had that familiar conviction that life was beginning over again with the summer.","2393": "He said to his friend, \"If the British march by land or sea from the town to-night, hang a lantern aloft in the belfry arch of the North Church tower as a signal light, - one, if by land, and two, if by sea; and I on the opposite shore will be, ready to ride and spread the alarm through every Middlesex village and farm, for the country folk to be up and to arm.\"","2394": "[In outer space,] you develop an instant global consciousness, a people orientation, an intense dissatisfaction with the state of the world, and a compulsion to do something about it.","2395": "Everybody in the world needs to do this. Everybody in the world needs to see. It was unbelieveable. Unbelieveable. I mean, the little things, the weightlessness. But to see the blue color go whip by, and now you're staring into blackness. That's the thing... And there's something you shoot through, and all of a sudden, as though you whip a sheet off you when you're asleep, and you're looking into blackness, into black ugliness. And you look down. There's the blue down there and black up there. And there is mother Earth and comfort. And up there... is that death? I don't know.","2396": "The thing that really surprised me was that it [Earth] projected an air of fragility. And why, I don't know. I don't know to this day. I had a feeling it's tiny, it's shiny, it's beautiful, it's home, and it's fragile.","2397": "I want everyone to love me, I want everyone to trust me. Not gonna happen, I think about this every day, and dream about it every night, what am I lacking?","2398": "After they came and destroyed the land, there was one spark of hope left for all of mankind.","2399": "Why should we live with such hurry and waste of life? We are determined to be starved before we are hungry.","2400": "I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived.","2401": "Within the space of a few decades, the way children understand and experience nature has changed radically. The polarity of the relationship has reversed. Today, kids are aware of the global threats to the environment - but their physical contact, their intimacy with nature, is fading. That's exactly the opposite of how it was when I was a child.","2402": "The shift in our relationship to the natural world is startling, even in settings that one would assume are devoted to nature. Not that long ago, summer camp was a place where you camped, hiked in the woods, learned about plants and animals, or told firelight stories about ghosts or mountain lions. As likely as not today, \"summer camp\" is a weight-loss camp, or a computer camp.","2403": "Our society is teaching young people to avoid direct experience in nature. That lesson is delivered in schools, families, even organizations devoted to the outdoors, and codified into the legal and regulatory structures of many of our communities. Our institutions... unconsciously associate nature with doom - while disassociating the outdoors from joy and solitude.","2404": "The postmodern notion that reality is only a construct - that we are what we program - suggests limitless human possibilities; but as the young spend less and less of their lives in natural surroundings, their senses narrow, physiologically and psychologically, and this reduces the richness of human experience.","2405": "We were like children lost in our own dream; we never knew love's a garden and hard to grow. We thought the magic would lead us upstream, but we fell. It's not our fault - it's how currents flow. Even though it's hard to know you are leaving this picture, you remain another memory of summer when we loved. Even the winter cold feels warm, shining with light from all I kept inside from you. That is how the heart can live on and on.","2406": "What happens to a heart when love ends? Does it fade into a shadow of remorse when it bends? Or can it fly to the sky like a bird - lighter than ever, stronger too? Oh, I think a heart always learns to come through. Where do the teardrops go when they dry? Do they follow all the raindrops and return to the sky? Even a sparrow with broken wings looks to the sun and finds a song; oh, I think the heart always learns to be strong. Where did the sorrow go? Who gave me back the sun, I don't know! Opening my eyes, I see blue skies...","9999": "The moon will never lie to anyone. Be like the moon. No one hates the moon or wants to kill it. The moon does not take antidepressants and never gets sent to prison. The moon never shot a guy in the face and ran away. The moon has been around a long time and has never tried to rip anyone off. The moon does not care who you want to touch or what color you are. The moon treats everyone the same. The moon never tries to get in on the guest list or use your name to impress others. Be like the moon. When others insult or belittle in an attempt to elevate themselves, the moon sits passively and watches, never lowering itself to anything that weak.

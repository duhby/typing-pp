1526: 14.043466: The early "Dudel-Sack" gave rise to a number of European, Asian and African folk bagpipes, namely, the Volynka (U.S.S.R.), the Bock (German), the Zukra (North Africa), the Gaita (Portugal and Spain), the Zampogna (Italy), the Cornemuse (France), the Moshug (India), the Zumarah (Egypt), and Flemish, Polish, Greek and Hungarian examples.
2188: 10.826366: The bands of light twisted together to form a comet tail. And then Luma emerged, reborn as a comet. The girl could scarcely believe her eyes. "But... how?" she kept asking. "Our destiny as Lumas is to transform into different things," said a red Luma who had suddenly appeared. "Stars, comets, planets... We can become all of these things!" "When I grow up, I want to become a star that makes someone special smile," said a green Luma. A blue Luma chimed in, "That Luma turned into a real cutie of a comet, didn't he!"
1427: 10.674539: Good morning, Agent P. Dr. Doofenshmirtz is on the move. We tracked him to these coordinates when we suddenly lost his signal. We have two scenarios to explain his disappearance. First, that magical elves have caused Dr. Doofenshmirtz to vanish to the land of angry corn people. The second is that he may be on this secret hideout-shaped island with the initial "D" carved into it, that satellites found at the exact... spot... where... he... vanished... uh. You know what, uh, forget the magical elves thing, way off base with that. Anyway, on your way, Agent P.
2252: 10.602677: During an SCP-001 event, flowers are observed to spontaneously appear and bloom over 90% of the viable land surface of the planet. These flowers are universally referred to as "vibrant", "bright", "beautiful", and/or words to this effect. The weather will clear, globally, with an ambient temperature recognised as comfortable by the majority of the populace. The global populace will become aware of the fate of the Earth, and of its inevitability. They will also experience heavily decreased levels of violence. SCP-001 will occur exactly 24 hours before the death of all life on the planet.
1523: 10.447807: From lowly Neanderthal and Cro-Magnon, to early warriors and medieval knights. All leading up to lunkhead basketball man. Yes, our culture worshiped the aggressor throughout the ages and we end up with spoiled, overpaid, bonehead athletes who contribute little to civilization other than slam dunks and touchdowns. That is the inevitable world of Troy Bolton. But the path of the mind, the path we're on, ours is the path that has brought us to these people: Eleanor Roosevelt, Frida Kahlo, Sandra Day O'Connor, Madame Curie, Jane Goodall, Oprah Winfrey, and so many others who the world reveres.
86: 10.356388: Life is a series of decisions. Whether you make the correct decisions or not doesn't matter. The important thing is to keep going forward. Years later, when you look back, perhaps you'll find that the incorrect decisions you made... weren't really incorrect. Similarly, the correct decisions... might not necessarily have been correct. Why struggle with frustration? Why proceed with confusion? In all things... resolution only comes from continuing to move forward. Following this line of reasoning, if there is no such thing as "incorrect," then how can the "correct" exist? Similarly, if there is no "correct," then how can the "incorrect" exist?
210: 10.264186: Oh, I'm a goofy goober, yeah! You're a goofy goober, yeah! We're all goofy goobers, yeah! Goofy, goofy, goober, goober, YEAH!
88: 10.191362: In the Cote Chalonnaise and the Maconnais to the south, plantings overtook those of Gamay in the 1980s so that there were 4,500 hectares by 1988 and 6,200 hectares by 2000. From the Cote Chalonnaise, the whites of Rully, Mercurey, and Montagny can offer economical, if slightly rustic, versions of the grander names of the Cote d'Or.
2380: 10.142792: "Send me your hungry, old Earth. Here's Sam Parkhill, his hot dogs all boiled, his chili cooking, everything neat as a pin. Come on, you Earth, send me your rocket!" "It sure makes you humble," he said among the cooking odors of wieners, warm buns, rich butter. "Step up," he invited the various stars in the sky. "Who'll be the first to buy?"
2365: 10.045967: What's your Wi-Fi password here? "There is no password." Oh cool, so - "All one word." Wait - "With underscores between each word."
112: 10.009521: Atticus said to Jem one day, "I'd rather you shot at tin cans in the backyard, but I know you'll go after birds. Shoot all the blue jays you want, if you can hit 'em, but remember it's a sin to kill a mockingbird." That was the only time I ever heard Atticus say it was a sin to do something, and I asked Miss Maudie about it. "Your father's right," she said. "Mockingbirds don't do one thing except make music for us to enjoy. They don't eat up people's gardens, don't nest in corn cribs, they don't do one thing but sing their hearts out for us. That's why it's a sin to kill a mockingbird."
394: 9.829413: You teach me and I'll teach you, Po-ke-mon! Gotta catch 'em all! Gotta catch 'em all! Every challenge along the way, with courage I will face! I will battle every day, to claim my rightful place! Come with me, the time is right, there's no better team! Arm in arm, we'll win the fight, it's always been our dream! Pokemon! Gotta catch 'em all! It's you and me, I know it's my destiny! Pokemon! Oh, you're my best friend, in a world we must defend! Pokemon! Gotta catch 'em all!
2182: 9.788072: Suddenly, more Lumas began to pop out from the apricot planet. They were different colors, but they all shouted the same thing. "My mama!" "My mama!" The sight of all the shouting Lumas only made the girl laugh harder. "What am I going to do with all these children?" The Lumas just stared blankly as she doubled over laughing. "I guess we'll have to name each and every one of you."
2137: 9.782168: My instinct was to say, with contrition: "I'm sorry, sir, I'm not prepared" - a considerable indignity - but in a rare moment of inspiration I decided to concoct a bluff, however lame. Said I: "Well, sir, this case was obviously meant to get us to... but I didn't do any of that. The case said that XYZ Company was in a very competitive industry... there would be no point in charging less than everyone else either. So I figured they should just keep charging what everybody else was charging, and I didn't do any calculations." Ahem. The professor blew his stack.
2379: 9.767883: "Come on," he said. "We've got to get the place fixed! All the hot dogs boiling, the buns warm, the chili cooking, the onions peeled and diced, the relish laid out, the napkins in the dips, the place spotless! Hey!" He did a little wild dance, kicking his heels. "Oh boy, I'm happy; yes sir, I'm happy," he sang off key. "This is my lucky day!"
2298: 9.737585: The sky - the genuine sky, not an artificial one - is falling, stopping, falling again, as if grand pieces of a celestial puzzle are being moved and switched by some befuddled god. And... watching it... her smile begins to gradually recede. The look in her eyes grows colder, her breathing slows, and the faint glimmer of excitement provided by this cataclysmic view is snuffed out, replaced with objectivity. Her opinion on the disaster destroying all is delivered in a single word. With a little appreciation, in a mostly hollow tone, she says, "Delightful." As if the word has any meaning. As if the fall has any meaning. As if the world has any meaning.
1437: 9.736828: Felony tax evasion. Yeah... $200 a day, 365 days a year since you were 12. So that's two decades, so times 20, which is $1,460,000, I think. I mean, I am just a dumb bunny, but we are good at multiplying. Anyway, according to your tax forms, you reported, let me see here... zero! Unfortunately, lying on a federal form is a punishable offense. Five years jail time.
1881: 9.643688: And lo, Zargothrax was finally defeated. But in the epic final struggle with the dark sorcerer, the valiant hero Angus McFife realised he had been impaled by the Knife of Evil. As he watched the lifeless corpse of Zargothrax dissolve into liquid dust, Angus knew that soon he himself would be corrupted by the dark power of that cursed blade. And so he resolved that he must make the final sacrifice for the Glory of Dundee. He would end his own life by descending into the raging volcanic fires of Schiehallion!
2285: 9.587201: I've been reading books of old - the legends and the myths: Achilles and his gold, Hercules and his gifts, Spiderman's control, and Batman with his fists; and clearly, I don't see myself upon that list. But she said, "where'd you wanna go? How much you wanna risk? I'm not looking for somebody with some superhuman gifts: some superhero, some fairytale bliss. Just something I can turn to - somebody I can kiss. I want something just like this."
2086: 9.576856: The QWERTY layout was created around the 1870s when typing was done on typewriters: that old, mechanical device that had a keyboard and directly printed letters onto a piece of paper using ink. The exact reasons for this design are still unclear - many people say the letters are laid out to make the most common keys harder to reach, therefore reducing the risk of jams - others believe the layout was a result of advice given by morse code telegraph operators. Regardless, the QWERTY layout was designed to solve a problem that no longer exists - so the question remains: why do we still use it?
2069: 9.573366: Let me explain... You've heard of wishing upon a shooting star? At the "Star Road", your wish is transformed into a star. When it's granted, it then turns into a shooting star and falls down to earth. So you see, the Star Road plays an integral role in granting wishes. But ever since a sword destroyed the "Star Road", everything's come to a halt. No stars have been made since. The way things stand, yours is a world where wishes can't come true anymore.
2216: 9.535969: If I had a diamond heart - oh-oh - I'd give you all my love if I was unbreakable. If I had a diamond heart - oh-oh - you could shoot me with a gun of gold. And if I was unbreakable, I'd walk straight through the bullet, bendin' like a tulip, blue-eyed and foolish - never mind the bruises - into the fire, breakin' through the wires; and give you all I've got. (If I had a diamond heart,) I'd walk straight through the dagger; never break the pattern: diamonds don't shatter, beautiful and battered; into the poison, cry you an ocean, and give you all I've got.
1998: 9.514536: "Alfred Simmonds, Horse Slaughterer and Glue Boiler, Willingdon. Dealer in Hides and Bonemeal. Kennels Supplied." Do you not understand what that means? They are taking Boxer to the knacker's!
1416: 9.51293: Ah, there you are, Agent P. We suspect your nemesis, Dr. Doofenshmirtz, has been pilfering bricks from buildings across the Tri-State Area. Animals are rioting, convicts are escaping from the zoo! It's chaos! You've got to stop him, Perry, before it all falls down.
2124: 9.502021: ...but my kinswoman made no effort to rise. I spoke gently to her. She burst into tears and sobbed pleadingly, "I don't want to go, Clark, I don't want to go!" I understood. For her, just outside the door of the concert-hall, lay the black pond with the cattle-tracked bluffs, the tall, unpainted house, naked as a tower, with weather-curled boards; the crook-backed ash-seedlings where the dishcloths hung to dry, the gaunt, moulting turkeys picking up refuse about the kitchen door.
2187: 9.487717: The pair traveled through the starry skies, and though they encountered many other comets, not one of them held Luma's mother. Luma was despondent. "Now, now, Luma. The rain clouds won't go away if you keep crying," the girl said, giving Luma a squeeze. "I'll give you a present if you stop." The girl closed her eyes and said gently, "I'll take care of you." With these words, she felt a small spark in her heart.
1854: 9.474076: The amenities of life have been chasing my soul. And my mind is transcendental, and I'm losing all control. And I'm sinking in the quagmire of illusions and Thoreau. I cry out "My name is T-Bone" as a hound-dog digs a hole. You ask so many questions, what answers should I choose? Is this Plato's heebie-jeebies or just existential blues?
1324: 9.453247: I know! You'd think a swank joint like this could spring for a real box of crayons! Oh, and watch your vocab, Kim, "ludicrous" is kind of a grownup word. Remember, you're 12, so maybe "doofy" or "stupido"?
1434: 9.424058: Finally, the plumber! The garbage disposal is backed up again. The same one you fixed last week, by the way! And while you're at it- Oh, who needs to see that?! Oh, I'll be in the other room. Oh, I mean for crying out loud- What, you're done already? But, you've only been here for like, 15 seconds. And I've been talking for like, half of that. What kind of a plumber are you? A platypus plumber? Perry the platypus plumber? Perry the Platypus!
2166: 9.420134: The FitnessGram Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues. The 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly, but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal. A single lap should be completed each time you hear this sound. Remember to run in a straight line, and run as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the word start. On your mark, get ready... start!
2189: 9.408484: Our story begins a very, very long time ago with a young girl. One day, this girl spotted a rusted spaceship holding a small star child. "What's your name? Are you lost?" the girl asked the star child. "I'm Luma, and I'm waiting for Mama. She's coming for me on a comet!" said the star child, who had been waiting day and night. "Don't worry, I'll wait with you," the little girl promised Luma.
21: 9.403757: This beastly predator's aggressive ejection of high-speed projectiles makes it one of the most fearsome creatures in the ecosystem. Its body seems to comprise of both biological and mechanical components, and represents one of the most evolutionarily advanced specimens ever observed. The chamber within its torso gives it rapid-fire bio-pellet launch capabilities. What appears to be a tail fin is in fact the base of its counter-weight and ammunition cylinder, so immobilizing this appendage will prevent the groink from attacking... at least in theory. Confirmation of this suspicion remains elusive, as nobody has volunteered to test it.
1271: 9.387285: Cherry MX Brown and Cherry MX Brown RGB switches are tactile-style switches, with a bump along the travel path that provides confirmation every time a keypress is registered. These switches are a balance between click switches and linear switches in terms of audio feedback provided and the force needed to register a keypress. They are preferred by gamers who prioritize accuracy over speed and users who enjoy instantly knowing whether a key was pressed.
213: 9.371234: I don't know how much you understand about what is happening outside your locked room, but strangely enough (despite your personality), you have a number of loyal idiots working on your behalf. I have already established an elite body called The Knights of the Idiotic Table. We will be holding an annual dinner at which we'll have fun talking crap about you. (No, you're not invited).
238: 9.36816: While some enzymes methylate the tails of histone proteins, a different set of enzymes can methylate certain bases in the DNA itself, usually cytosine. Such DNA methylation occurs in most plants, animals, and fungi. Long stretches of inactive DNA, such as that of inactivated mammalian X chromosomes.
2177: 9.36415: Refreshed by food, Dill recited this narrative: having been bound in chains and left to die in the basement, Dill worked himself free by pulling the chains from the wall. Still in wrist manacles, he wandered two miles out of Meridian where he discovered a small animal show and was immediately engaged to wash the camel. He traveled with the show all over Mississippi until his infallible sense of direction told him he was in Abbott County, Alabama, just across the river from Maycomb. He walked the rest of the way. "How'd you get here?" asked Jem.
2218: 9.338266: I had seen him cry a few times before. It only happened when he was singing or when someone else sang a song that moved him. He played the three-string shamisen, which Kiyo and I called his "pinko-pinko." We would laugh together when we heard him plucking it and whining out Japanese melodies. We would hold our ears and giggle. It was always a great joke between us, except for those rare times when Papa began to weep at the lyrics. Then we would just stare quietly - as I did that night - from some hidden corner of the room. This was always mysterious and incomprehensible.
1373: 9.328141: No? Well, he'll look fabulous anyway. Your boy's suit I designed to withstand enormous friction without heating up or wearing out. A useful feature. Your daughter's suit was tricky. But I finally created a sturdy material that will disappear completely as she does. Your suit can stretch as far as you can, without injuring yourself, and still retain its shape. Virtually indestructible... yet it breathes like Egyptian cotton. As an extra feature, each suit contains a homing device, giving you the precise global location of the wearer at the touch of a button. Well, darling? What do you think?
2174: 9.319339: This time, I split my knuckle to the bone on his front teeth. My left impaired, I sailed in with my right, but not for long. Uncle Jack pinned my arms to my sides and said, "Stand still!" Aunt Alexandra ministered to Francis, wiping his tears away with her handkerchief, rubbing his hair, patting his cheek. Atticus, Jem, and Uncle Jimmy had come to the back porch when Francis started yelling. Who started this? said Uncle Jack.
1638: 9.313087: Yeah, I knew Lotso. He was a good toy. A friend. Me and him, we had the same kid, Daisy. I was there when Lotso got unwrapped. Daisy loved us all. But Lotso, Lotso was special. They did everything together. You've never seen a kid and a toy more in love. One day, we took a drive, hit a rest stop, had a little playtime. After lunch, Daisy fell asleep. She never came back. Lotso wouldn't give up. It took forever, but we finally made it back to Daisy's. But by then, it was too late. Something changed that day inside Lotso, something snapped.
1859: 9.290533: "You know," said Arthur, "it's at times like this, when I'm trapped in a Vogon airlock with a man from Betelgeuse, and about to die of asphyxiation in deep space that I really wish I'd listened to what my mother told me when I was young." Why, what did she tell you? "I don't know, I didn't listen."
1879: 9.286607: I'm waking up, I am alive but I feel so strange. All I remind is the invincible line of the enemies. I see my fall as if I'm living it now. But I'm here, I'm chained to this metal bed. I'm alive, what's happened that day? Where am I now? What is this iron room? Please, help me now! Look to your right, I heard a voice inside my mind, "You will no longer live your old life". Inside your cells there's something you're gonna pay: your DNA. I look to the right, I see the planet Earth through a glass. I'm in their starship out in space, I've been captured by alien scum.
28: 9.269751: The Terminator's an infiltration unit. Part man, part machine. Underneath, it's a hyperalloy combat chassis, microprocessor-controlled, fully armored. Very tough but outside, it's living human tissue. Flesh, skin, hair, blood. Grown for the cyborgs.
1367: 9.269138: Complaints? I can handle. What I can't handle is your customers' inexplicable knowledge of Insuricare's inner workings! They're experts! Experts, Bob! Exploiting every loophole, dodging every obstacle! They're penetrating the bureaucracy!
2181: 9.251785: One night, the girl dreamed about her own mother. "Where are you going?" she asked her mother's retreating back. Without turning, her mother replied, "Don't fret, dearest. I'm not going anywhere. I'm always watching over you, like the sun in the day and the moon in the night." A wave of sadness washed over the girl. "What about when it rains, and I can't see the sun or the moon?" Her mother thought for a moment before responding. "I will turn into a star in the clouds and wait for your tears to dry."
1432: 9.242742: Oh! Agent P! It appears that Doofenshmirtz has made some rather unusual purchases: chicken wire, three metric tons of baking soda, and lederhosen. You know, those leather windpipe shorts that make you look like a walking cuckoo clock? Man, he is one sick puppy.
1396: 9.223952: Oh, are you my new temp? Well, let me just get you up to speed. I know it's a bit of a mess. I'm just putting the finishing touches of my latest maniacal plan. You see, in a few minutes, I will unleash an unprecedented reign of terror upon the entire... Tri-State Area! And Perry the Platypus will never be the wiser. Perry the Platypus?! You're a temp? Are times that hard?
1379: 9.22334: Oh, I'm real. Real enough to defeat YOU! And I did it without your precious gifts, your oh-so-special powers. I'll give them heroics. I'll give them the most spectacular heroics anyone's ever seen! And when I'm old and I've had my fun, I'll sell my inventions so that everyone can be superheroes. Everyone can be super! And when everyone's super... no one will be.
1312: 9.21305: "Ace reporter Ron Stoppable, heralded for breaking the story of TV fake. Adrena Lynn's ratings plummet faster than her fake fall." Can this get any more annoying?
784: 9.206505: The Kia Stinger. Despite its stunning good looks and an impressive spec sheet, we didn't quite know what to make of the red four-door liftback when it first rolled up to the front door. After all, this is the Korean company's first serious attempt at a sport sedan, whereas we knew what to expect from Hyundai's then-new Genesis luxury marque, a premium sporty midsize Kia aimed at the Germans was quite the proposal.
1261: 9.194578: Buzz Lightyear Mission Log. Stardate 4072: My ship has run off course en route to Sector 12. I've crash landed on a strange planet. The impact must have awoken me from hyper-sleep. Terrain seems a bit unstable. No read-out yet if the air is breathable and there seems to be no signs of intelligent life anywhere.
414: 9.174535: I don't get it. I made my house a mess, which was making it clean, which made Squidward clean my yard, but that really means he's messing it up. But the opposite of clean is filth, which means filth is clean, that means Squidward is really making my yard a wreck, but I normally wreck my own yard which means Squidward is being the opposite of Squidward which means he's SpongeBob!
240: 9.173658: For twelve years you've been asking "Who is John Galt?" This is John Galt speaking. I'm the man who's taken away your victims and thus destroyed your world. You've heard it said that this is an age of moral crisis and that Man's sins are destroying the world. But your chief virtue has been sacrifice, and you've demanded more sacrifices at every disaster. You've sacrificed justice to mercy and happiness to duty. So why should you be afraid of the world around you?
217: 9.148032: Only boxers can understand the loneliness of tennis players - and yet boxers have their corner men and managers. Even a boxer's opponent provides a kind of companionship, someone he can grapple with and grunt at. In tennis you stand face-to-face with the enemy, trade blows with him, but never touch him or talk to him, or anyone else. The rules forbid a tennis player from even talking to his coach while on the court. People sometimes mention the track-and-field runner as a comparably lonely figure, but I have to laugh. At least the runner can feel and smell his opponents. They're inches away. In tennis you're on an island. Of all the games men and women play, tennis is the closest to solitary confinement.
1525: 9.138901: The grip or leumluath (lem-loo-ah) is a movement from Low G, "D" grace note, Low G, back to the melody note. Like the D throw, it is important to play the first Low G clearly. Notice that the grip on a D uses a B instead of a D grace note.
1617: 9.137786: It's out with the old and in with the new. Goodbye clouds of gray, hello skies of blue. A dip in the pool, a trip to the spa, endless days in my chaise, the whole world according to moi. Excuse me? Thank you. Iced tea imported from England. Lifeguards imported from Spain. Towels imported from Turkey, and turkey imported from Maine. We're gonna relax and renew. You go do! I want fabulous, that is my simple request. All things fabulous, bigger and better and best. I need something inspiring to help me get along. I need a little fabulous, is that so wrong?
1418: 9.126586: Oh, hey, Agent P. So, get this, I got this memo this morning on Doofenshmirtz, and someone abbreviated his name in it. Guess how they wrote it? Doof! The Doof! It's times like these when you really appreciate having a cool name like Monogram.
2054: 9.126022: I feel the sun on my face. I see trees all around me, the scent of wildflowers on a breeze. It's so beautiful. In this moment, I'm not stranded in space. It's been 97 years since a nuclear apocalypse killed everyone on Earth, leaving the planet simmering in radiation. Fortunately, there were survivors. 12 nations had operational space stations at the time of the bombs. There is now only the Ark, one station forged from the many. We're told the Earth needs another 100 years to become survivable again. Four more space-locked generations and man can go home, back to the ground. The ground, that's the dream. This is reality.
1654: 9.117172: Freedom, calls my name. Serenity, keeps me sane. Happiness, it dulls the pain. Honest, to see my place. Open, to other ways. Willingness, to understand. Justice, but do not judge. Courtesy, for others' flaws. Kindness, it's not that hard. Self-restraint, of tongue and pen. Inventory, my daily friend. Analysis, let down your guard. Look in the mirror, what do you see? The shattered fortress that once bound me.
1513: 9.099531: Exactly my point! He was the Phantom of the Opera on Broadway. Now my mom, she's seen that musical twenty-seven times. And she put Michael Crawford's picture in our refrigerator. Yeah, not on it, in it. So my point is, if you play basketball, you're gonna end up on a cereal box. If you sing in musicals, you're gonna end up in my mom's refrigerator.
2199: 9.099276: We are taught not to gamble. Perhaps it is thought we have lost enough already: legs, vision, speech, the typical use of our bodies. Others' fears would teach us to cringe at any thought of any risk. Disability and risk don't mix. Risk is something we are supposed to be protected from - by agencies, by professionals - by parents, by doctors - by invisibility, by shame - by confinement if necessary. We must be kept safe: This is one of the lies which fills the beds of the so-called "homes." So we embrace the risks to fight the lies.
1402: 9.096716: Ah, Perry the Platypus. Your timing is impeccable. And by "impeccable," I mean completely peccable!
2183: 9.09356: She remembered rubbing the sleep out of her eyes as she followed her father up that hill to look at the stars... she remembered having picnics with her mother on that hill on bright and windy days... and... "I want to go home! I want to go home right now!" The girl burst into tears, and the Lumas didn't know what to do. The girl was shouting now, her face wet with tears. "But I know she's not there! I knew all along that she wasn't out there in the sky! Because... because... she's sleeping under the tree on the hill!" The girl's cries echoed through the stars, and a hush fell over the area.
783: 9.083946: Asked about aerodynamics, Reichman emphasized his team's concern for stability, this is a rather fast vehicle after all. This encouraged serious testing to confirm its capabilities, including making use of computational fluid dynamics, a far cry from using tufts of yarn taped to an already-determined form. For a large vehicle, the weight is much less than some of its rivals, in part due to materials choices. The main structure is aluminum, but to avoid the high-stress, high-weight problems of a rear liftgate, the team made the entire frame for the rear opening out of composites and made the lift panel composite, as well.
2281: 9.041713: The bottom line? Today's organic farming practices are probably best deployed in fruit and vegetable farms, where growing nutrition (not just bulk calories) is the primary goal. But for delivering sheer calories, especially in our staple crops of wheat, rice, maize, soybeans and so on, conventional farms have the advantage right now.
1834: 9.026883: "Here I am and here I remain!", he barked. There was an abortive movement of flagons toward mouths - stopped as the Duke remained with arm upraised. "My toast is one of those maxims so dear to our hearts: 'Business makes progress! Fortune passes everywhere!'"
1439: 9.000485: I trusted you, Nicky. I welcomed you into my home. We broke bread together. Grandmama made you a cannoli. And how did you repay my generosity? With a rug, made from the butt of a skunk. A skunk butt rug. You disrespected me. You disrespected my Grandmama, whom I buried in that skunk butt rug. I told you never to show your face here again, but here you are, snooping around with this... What are you, a performer? What's with the costume?
1073: 8.94466: What car enthusiast doesn't love a small, two-seat roadster with a manual gearbox and a high-revving dual overhead cam engine? For those reasons and many others, Honda's S2000 sports car, launched for the 2000 model year, became an instant hit.
2204: 8.943954: Use why-how laddering to flesh out varying user needs and find a middle ground that's both meaningful and actionable. As a general rule, asking "why" yields abstract statements and asking "how" yields specific statements. Often times abstract statements are more meaningful, but not as actionable. The opposite is true of more specific statements.
1241: 8.912355: Woody, you're not a collector's item. You're a child's plaything. You... are... A TOY! For how much longer? One more rip, and Andy's done with me. And what do I do then, Buzz? Huh? You tell me! Somewhere in that pad of stuffing is a toy who taught me that life's only worth living if you're being loved by a kid. And I traveled all this way to rescue that toy because I believed him.
964: 8.902994: It's all meaningless. No matter what dreams or hopes you had, it's all the same if you're shredded by rocks. Everyone will die someday. Does that mean life is meaningless? Would you say that of our fallen comrades? Their lives, were they meaningless? No, they weren't! It's us who gives meaning to our fallen comrade's lives! We die trusting the living who follow to find meaning in our lives! That is the sole method in which we can rebel against this cruel world!
2032: 8.896912: "All of it, all of it," Hammond said. "Everything on that island is state-of-the-art. You'll see for yourself, Donald. It's perfectly wonderful. That's why this... concern... is so misplaced. There's absolutely no problem with the island."
1742: 8.873211: The naming conventions of Python's library are a bit of a mess, so we'll never get this completely consistent - nevertheless, here are the currently recommended naming standards. New modules and packages (including third party frameworks) should be written to these standards, but where an existing library has a different style, internal consistency is preferred.
2141: 8.859673: As psychologists developed and refined IQ testing, classification systems were established, and any child with an IQ of above 70 was considered "normal", while those with scores above 130 were considered "gifted".
2084: 8.856047: "I won't shout at you," Nynaeve shouted. "And all the rest, too. I promise, you... you...!" She gobbled on the edge of swallowing her tongue as she realized she could not call him one of the names he warranted without breaking the promise already. And yet, the effect of her shout was most gratifying.
67: 8.848792: You know what? You're right. He was just a stupid bureaucrat. A stupid paper-pushing bureaucrat. A stupid I-dotting, chair squashing... Oh. No offense, Hermes. You're not like that. I mean, you're exactly like that, but you're okay!
2156: 8.841339: I begin to call Morrie "Coach," the way I used to address my high school track coach. Morrie likes the nickname. "Coach," he says. "All right, I'll be your coach. And you can be my player. You can play all the lovely parts of life that I'm too old for now."
2152: 8.83687: Well son, I'll tell you: life for me ain't been no crystal stair. It's had tacks in it, and splinters, and boards torn up, and places with no carpet on the floor - bare. But all the time I'se been a-climbin' on, and reachin' landin's, and turnin' corners, and sometimes goin' in the dark where there ain't been no light. So boy, don't you turn back. Don't you set down on the steps 'cause you finds it's kinder hard. Don't you fall now - for I'se still goin', honey, I'se still climbin, and life for me ain't been no crystal stair.
1885: 8.83657: Alone I walk among the twisting shadows, tempted by the ancient magic: the Power of Five. My desire to mirror my own image and I will offer you no soul - offer you no soul. Tonight darkness will shadow the light. Symmetry divine, there's no force greater dividing the Fathers of Time. Feel my hate, I'm banished to this wasteland. My Serpents plot the overthrow of your temples and shrines. In the night, my army's rage and fury burning my shadow into the land, vengeance by my hand.
1255: 8.832575: Why would Andy want you? Look at you! You're a Buzz Lightyear! Any other toy would give up his moving parts just to be you. You've got wings, you glow in the dark, you talk, your helmet does that... that whoosh thing. You're a cool toy. As a matter of fact, you're too cool. I mean - what chance does a toy like me have against a Buzz Lightyear action figure?
1882: 8.832252: Such a pathetic display of valor! You are naught but insignificant worms before the infinite power of Zargothrax! Now, the solar conjunction is at hand, my ascension to godhood is inevitable! And there is NOTHING you can do to stop me. Worship my omnipotence!
2319: 8.831828: Our agile brain processes many things simultaneously by means of parallel processing. To focus on this multitrack processing, one information-processing model, connectionism, views memories as products of interconnected neural networks. Specific memories arise from particular activation patterns within these networks. Every time you learn something new, your brain's neural connections change, forming and strengthening pathways that allow you to interact with and learn from your constantly changing environment.
1612: 8.829375: I see what's happening, yeah. You're face to face with greatness and it's strange. You don't even know how you feel, it's adorable! Well, it's nice to see that humans never change. Open your eyes, let's begin. Yes, it's really me, it's Maui, breathe it in. I know it's a lot, the hair, the bod, when you're staring at a demigod. What can I say except you're welcome, for the tides, the sun, the sky. Hey, it's okay, it's okay, you're welcome. I'm just an ordinary demi-guy!
2395: 8.824098: Everybody in the world needs to do this. Everybody in the world needs to see. It was unbelieveable. Unbelieveable. I mean, the little things, the weightlessness. But to see the blue color go whip by, and now you're staring into blackness. That's the thing... And there's something you shoot through, and all of a sudden, as though you whip a sheet off you when you're asleep, and you're looking into blackness, into black ugliness. And you look down. There's the blue down there and black up there. And there is mother Earth and comfort. And up there... is that death? I don't know.
1355: 8.821545: Superladies, they're always trying to tell you their secret identity. Think it'll strengthen the relationship or something like that. I said, "Girl, I don't want to know about your mild-mannered alter ego." Or anything like that. I mean, you tell me you're a super-mega-ultra-lightning-babe, that's all right with me. I'm good. I'm good.
412: 8.796586: This is the story of a man named Stanley. Stanley worked for a company in a big building where he was Employee 427. Employee 427's job was simple: he sat at his desk in Room 427 and he pushed buttons on a keyboard. Orders came to him through a monitor on his desk, telling him what buttons to push, how long to push them, and in what order. This is what Employee 427 did every day of every month of every year, and although others may have considered it soul rending, Stanley relished every moment that the orders came in, as though he had been made exactly for this job. And Stanley was happy.
1589: 8.782684: Also large bugs, men with pointy teeth, and stop, no more, you'll just upset me. Mother's right here, Mother will protect you. Darling, here's what I suggest, skip the drama, stay with mama. Mother knows best. Go ahead, get trampled by a rhino. Go ahead, get mugged and left for dead. Me, I'm just your mother, what do I know? I only bathed and changed and nursed you. Go ahead and leave me, I deserve it. Let me die alone here, be my guest. When it's too late, you'll see, just wait. Mother knows best.
1461: 8.762368: Miles, it's your dad. Please open the door. Miles, I can see your shadow moving around. Yeah, okay, I get it. I get it. You're still ignoring me. Look, can we talk for a minute? Something happened to... Look, sometimes people drift apart, Miles. And I don't want that to happen to us, okay? Look, I know I don't always do what you need me to do, or say what you need me to say, but I see this spark in you. It's amazing. It's why I push you. But it's yours, and whatever you choose to do with it, you'll be great. Look, call me when you can. Okay? I love you. You don't have to say it back though.
1880: 8.741233: We will steal into your soul. Ride now! Despair and pain inside my heart become a fearful hate. Death pictures in my mind, the start, for me to seal your fate. There is just one thing I'm thinking of. What'd you think milord? Speak, now, to your horde! Dissolution of his power, dust and ash I want! I am your hunter, I'll capture you for all the disaster and pain, you brought to this world. Hate raising up, my heart is burning for. These wounds that will not heal. Take my word this time for real. I am your punisher and my revenge, will strike you fierce and quick!
1414: 8.7383375: Then I can go on to eliminate all the other annoyances that make my skin crawl. Like, uh... Nature! Beauty! Morning talk show hosts! Soon, there will be nothing that can withstand the wrath of Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz!
1884: 8.733758: What's become of the world, the colors unfurl revealing a blackened haze. Conditioned to fear, the voice that we hear calling the end of days. Millions of souls under control like pawns to a king, led by a string to the final hour. Lords of technology that fell into the void. Oh shall it be as it was before. Tragedy on every shore. Is this the end of all we know. Innocence lost so long ago. Woven in dreams, the darkest of schemes now takes hold of our destiny. Decades of greed, plague, famine and war, we can't go on like this anymore. Living like fools, chaos will rule this eternal paradise.
1898: 8.733568: Lost in a dream, finally it seems, emptiness and everlasting madness. See the sadness grow, watching as we know, long before our journey for the world. Call for us, the power in all of us. So far beyond the blackened sky tonight. Glorious, forever more in us, we are victorious, and so alive. We'll all find our sacrifice tomorrow, our journey on towards a brighter day. Silent tears we left behind, still so far away, across the endless sands through the fields of our despair. Free for all eternity, we stand. Rise above the universe tonight, Starchaser.
1342: 8.73166: Look at him, all ticked off. He doesn't get it. He doesn't know my secret. What a sap! He still can't even tell that I adore him. Look Brainy, this is just weird. How is it that you're standing behind me again? How did you get in this little arch? Were you waiting for me to come into this alley? What's your deal? OK, I'm not gonna hit you this time. This one's for free. Today I'm feeling generous. But tomorrow, look out.
2296: 8.726754: She doesn't have much left before she falls from weariness alone. Perhaps she could find an anomaly, but say she couldn't. What then? She couldn't, so, "then" is "now." So? How do you go on when the way is completely obstructed? Should you...? Go on?
2221: 8.712442: While recruiting for this unit and speeding up the relocation program, the government figured it could simultaneously weed out the "disloyal" and thus get a clearer idea of exactly how many agents and Japanese sympathizers it actually had to deal with. The part of it would have been comical if the results were not so grotesque. No self-respecting espionage agent would willingly admit he was disloyal.
2375: 8.704247: They stood on the porches and tried to believe in the existence of Earth, much as they had once tried to believe in the existence of Mars; it was a problem reversed. But now, tonight, the dead were risen, Earth was reinhabited, memory awoke, a million names were spoken: What was so-and-so doing tonight on Earth? What about this one and that one? The people on the porches glanced sidewise at each other's faces. At nine o'clock Earth seemed to explode, catch fire, and burn. The people on the porches put up their hands as if to beat the fire out. They waited.
2356: 8.7041235: I marched ahead into the dark because I wanted to find a better truth. However, the truth is as bitter and merciless as I'd always assumed. I've been in this state for too long to count. I have lost the minutes and hours. And every so often I will see it again: Light - true light - in the distance. Perhaps it has been guiding me. I wouldn't admit this, to anyone. It's like a loss: relinquishing myself to what I've long criticized. However, I feel it for certain: that light is now beckoning me. That light of the old world is shining, and wants me. And in that light, I find deliverance...
19: 8.7029705: In 2291, in an attempt to control violence among deep space miners, the New Earth Government legalized no-holds-barred fighting. The Liandri Mining Corporation established a series of leagues and bloody public exhibitions. Soon, Liandri discovered that the public matches were their most profitable enterprise.
137: 8.696319: I walked up to Griz and poked him in the chest. "Let me make this perfectly clear to you. Though some might seek to make it appear otherwise, I am not a bride to be bartered away to another kingdom, not a prize of war, not a mouthpiece for your Komizar. I am not a chip in a card game to be mindlessly tossed into the center of the pot, nor one to be kept in the tight fist of a greedy opponent. I am a player seated at the table alongside everyone else, and from this day forward, I will play my own hand as I see fit. Do you understand me? Because the consequences could be ugly if someone thought otherwise."
2367: 8.684284: Okay, our top-selling microwave oven is in need of some new features. Any ideas? "You know how it has a built-in clock? What if when it's between midnight and six AM all the beeps are three times as loud?" ... That's fantastic. People will love that.
1300: 8.681535: This is my mom's house. Do you promise to look out for your brothers... No matter what the peril... Will you defend Oozma Kappa? No matter how dangerous? No matter how insurmountable the odds may be? From evils both great and small? In the face of unending pain and... Oh! Forget it! You're in!
1541: 8.672252: You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset. She's going off about something that you said, 'cause she doesn't get your humor like I do. I'm in my room, it's a typical Tuesday night. I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like and she'll never know your story like I do. But she wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts. She's cheer captain and I'm on the bleachers dreaming about the day when you wake up and find that what you're looking for has been here the whole time. If you could see that I'm the one who understands you. Been here all along, so, why can't you see? You belong with me.
1650: 8.671914: Where did we come from? Why are we here? Where do we go when we die? What lies beyond, and what lay before? Is anything certain in life? They say "Life is too short. The here and the now", and "You're only given one shot", but there could be more. Have I lived before, or could this be all that we've got? If I die tomorrow, I'd be alright, because I believe that after we're gone the spirit carries on.
1104: 8.667337: I'm the Big Bob-omb, baron of all blasting matter, king of ka-booms the world over! How dare you scale my mountain? By what right do you set foot on my imperial mountaintop? You may have eluded my guards, but you'll never escape my grasp... and you'll never take away my Power Star. I hereby challenge you Mario! If you want the star I hold, you must prove yourself in battle. Can you pick me up and hurl me to this royal turf? I think that you cannot!
2085: 8.664442: But instead, our standard is this layout called "qwerty". You might guess, "oh, it's probably because layout designers found this layout was the fastest." It must take the most common letters and put them in the most easily accessible locations. That, is not true.
9999: 8.659322: The moon will never lie to anyone. Be like the moon. No one hates the moon or wants to kill it. The moon does not take antidepressants and never gets sent to prison. The moon never shot a guy in the face and ran away. The moon has been around a long time and has never tried to rip anyone off. The moon does not care who you want to touch or what color you are. The moon treats everyone the same. The moon never tries to get in on the guest list or use your name to impress others. Be like the moon. When others insult or belittle in an attempt to elevate themselves, the moon sits passively and watches, never lowering itself to anything that weak. The moon is beautiful and bright. It needs no makeup to look beautiful. The moon never shoves clouds out of its way so it can be seen. The moon needs not fame or money to be powerful. The moon never asks you to go to war to defend it. Be like the moon.
1900: 8.652232: I will tell you the story of the surprise on that day. I will tell why I am doing so. I did not expect a thing and it's a wonderful thing for my way of life. He said "Do you wanna touch a star? Do you wanna shine more than ever?", I said "I wanna do so by all meanings". I thought such a chance was rare. I got excited very much. At that time I didn't hesitate to make up my mind. Now I feel the change slowly but surely. Oh can I catch the star like everyone else? I know I should 'cause I wanna get it, ready, fly high!
1347: 8.650406: Hey! Good morning, Monstropolis. It's now five after the hour of 6:00 A.M. in the big monster city. Temperature's a balmy 65 degrees, which is good news for you reptiles and, it looks like it's going to be a perfect day to maybe, hey, just lie in bed, sleep in or simply... Work out that flab that's hanging over the bed! Get up, Sulley!
1868: 8.646792: If you want to know what's behind the show, you ride my carousel and enter life's jail cell. Love and blood begin to meld, you've lost the self that you once held. Merry go round your head - awake, asleep, alive, or dead. The clown that painted a smile on you, is now the one unmasking you. Animated scenes unwind. Dormant figures come to life. Entangled in your own web, a twisted tunnel overhead. A glimpse of light, a drop of dew. You slide into the swimming pool.
2040: 8.643876: In the past, I have made no secret of my disdain for Chef Gusteau's famous motto: Anyone can cook. But I realize, only now do I truly understand what he meant. Not everyone can become a great artist, but a great artist can come from anywhere. It is difficult to imagine more humble origins than those of the genius now cooking at Gusteau's, who is, in this critic's opinion, nothing less than the finest chef in France. I will be returning to Gusteau's soon, hungry for more.
1068: 8.643618: Achilles (a Greek warrior, the fleetest of foot of all mortals) and a Tortoise are standing together on a dusty runway in the hot sun. Far down the runway, on a tall flagpole, there hangs a large rectangular flag. The flag is solid red, except where a thin ring-shaped hole has been cut out of it, through which one can see the sky.
1441: 8.642927: The kind that needs to be muzzled? The kind that makes you think you need to carry around fox repellent? Yeah, don't think I didn't notice that little item the first time we met! So l-let me ask you a question: are you afraid of me? Do you think I might go nuts? Think I might go savage? You think that I might try to... eat you?! I knew it. Just when I thought somebody actually believed in me, huh? Probably best if you don't have a predator as a partner.
1582: 8.641066: That's why I'm here, Mr. Freeman. I have recommended your services to my employers, and they have authorized me to offer you a job. They agree with me that you have limitless potential. You've proved yourself a decisive man, so I don't expect you'll have any trouble deciding what to do. If you're interested, just step into the portal and I will take that as a yes. Otherwise, well, I can offer you a battle you have no chance of winning. Rather an anticlimax, after what you've just survived. Time to choose. It's time to choose.
2284: 8.640539: Where do all the dreams return when they melt away? Where do all the broken-hearted songs stop singing and resign themselves to fate? Why did you go, though we were running freely through open meadows of fire and waterfalls? I thought we'd always last in this story we brought into being. Now all I am is leaving me so slowly; I'll never understand why I'm lonely: we once had it all. It only comes in my mind in shattered little frames all of the times my heart hears your name: I loved you - I loved you in my universe. How can it end? Refrain; I can't amend this pain...
215: 8.637784: It's no accident, I think, that tennis uses the language of life. Advantage, service, fault, break, love, the basic elements of tennis are those of everyday existence, because every match is a life in miniature. Even the structure of tennis, the way the pieces fit inside one another like Russian nesting dolls, mimics the structure of our days. Points become games become sets become tournaments, and it's all so tightly connected that any point can become the turning point. It reminds me of the way seconds become minutes become hours, and any hour can be our finest. Or darkest. It's our choice.
1374: 8.636037: You are Elastigirl! My God! Pull yourself together! What will you do, is... is-is this a question?! You will show him you remember that he is Mr. Incredible, and you will remind him who you are! Well, you don't know where he is, go, confront the problem! Fight! WIN!
2185: 8.634876: That night, when the girl lay down to sleep, a soft light enveloped her and reminded her of the blue planet she once called home. "But it would be nice to return home once every one hundred years to nap in my favorite sleeping nook." The comet carrying the Lumas and the girl continues on its journey to this very day. With more "family members" in tow than can be counted, it's said that the comet visits the girl's home planet once every hundred years, its proud white tail glittering in the sky.
2094: 8.628804: I continued getting better every day - after two weeks, I got my first 100 words per minute score. After a month, my first average of a hundred. I was feeling good: my improvement was consistent, and at this rate, I'd be catching up to my QWERTY speed soon. But improving at typing is not a linear process: even though I was getting better every day, after you reach a certain skill level, your improvement rate starts to slow down, just like any other skill. And that reality started to hit me.
1753: 8.622437: Ranges are a way of making lists that are arithmetic sequences of elements that can be enumerated. Numbers can be enumerated. One, two, three, four, etc. Characters can also be enumerated. The alphabet is an enumeration of characters from A to Z. Names can't be enumerated. What comes after "John"? I don't know.
2257: 8.621959: It was a wicked and wild wind: blew down the doors to let me in. Shattered windows and the sounds of drums - people couldn't believe what I'd become: just a puppet on a lonely string. Oh, who would ever want to be King! I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing; Roman Cavalry choirs are singing. Be my mirror, my sword, my shield - my missionaries in a foreign field. For some reason I can't explain, once you'd gone, there was never, never an honest word - and that was when I ruled the world.
1106: 8.609518: A group of English separatists sought even more religious freedom and fled to Holland in 1608, only to find life in this foreign country totally unsuited to their needs and temperament. They decided to relocate. They gained permission from the London Company to settle in Virginia. Thus authorized, they departed Holland and sailed aboard the Mayflower to the New World.
1407: 8.608669: So, he was totally checkin' me out, when lil' Ms. Pants walks in front of me. Yeah, yeah. So, I was like, "Um, hello", and she was like, "Oh no, you didn't", then I was like, "Oh, yes I did".
1675: 8.59765: Why do I feel so numb, is it something to do with where I come from? Should this be fight or flight? I don't know why I'm constantly so uptight. Rapid heartbeat pounding through my chest, agitated body in distress. I feel like I'm in danger, daily life is strangled by my stress. A stifling surge shooting through all my veins, extreme apprehension, suddenly I'm insane. Lost all hope for redemption. A grave situation, desperate at best.
1877: 8.596914: Reporting live from the tallest building in Tokyo. Long ways from them hard ways. Bills and Os and oh-yays. Dade County always, 305 all day. Now, baby, we can parlay or, baby, we can party. She read books, especially about red rooms and tie-ups. I got it hooked, 'cause she seen me in a suit with the red tie tied up. Christian Gris, nice to meet ya, but time is money, only difference is I own it. Now let's stop time and enjoy this moment.
1466: 8.5905285: My name's Ralph, and I'm a bad guy. Uh, let's see... I'm nine feet tall, I weigh six hundred and forty-three pounds. Got a little bit of a temper on me. My passions bubble very near the surface, I guess, not gonna lie. Anyhoo, what else? Uh... I'm a wrecker. I wreck things, professionally. I mean, I'm very good at what I do. Probably the best I know.
2212: 8.575185: Your body does not eliminate poisons by knowing their names. To try to control fear or depression or boredom by calling them names is to resort to superstition of trust in curses and invocations. It is so easy to see why this does not work. Obviously, we try to know, name, and define fear in order to make it "objective," that is, separate from "I."
132: 8.573243: Making mistakes is part of learning to choose well. No way around it. Choices are thrust upon us, and we don't always get things right. Even postponing or avoiding a decision can become a choice that carries heavy consequences. Mistakes can be painful-sometimes they cause irrevocable harm-but welcome to Earth. Poor choices are part of growing up, and part of life. You will make bad choices, and you will be affected by the poor choices of others. We must rise above such things.
2161: 8.564282: ...eventually a deep silence falls and we begin to notice the smallest sounds, the radiator humming in the corner of the room, the nasal breathing of one of the fat students. Some of us are agitated. When is he going to say something? We squirm, check our watches. A few students look out the window, trying to be above it all. This goes on a good fifteen minutes, before Morrie finally breaks in with a whisper. "What's happening here?" he asks.
2273: 8.557064: For 80 years Arrakis belonged to House Harkonnen. Eighty years of owning the spice fields. Can you imagine the wealth? In your eyes, I need to see it in your eyes. You never met Harkonners before. I have. They are not human. They're brutal! You have to be ready.
1397: 8.552275: Follow-up single?! Who do you think we are, some two-bit hacks who will keep writing you songs simply because you pay us obscene amounts of cash? Phineas and the Ferb-Tones are strictly a one-hit wonder. Good day to you, sir. Diva tantrum, check. Elevator music, check.
1297: 8.551382: Yeah, I'm a Sullivan! I'm the Sullivan who flunked every test! The one who got kicked out of the program! The one who's so afraid to let everyone down, that I cheated! And I lied! Mike, I'll never know how you feel. But you're not the only failure here. I act scary, Mike. But most of the time... I'm terrified.
1670: 8.535745: What is your shady scheme? It must be so dangerous. Can't you hear others scream? Why are you calm? Your greed is endless. You do not feel anything. Your mind is a dull one. Your existence is annoying. It's not my idea of fun. Shut your mouth. Do not say anything more to me. You don't know your business, I can not agree. You never reveal your ambition. Can't put up with your thinking, that's the limit. No more!
1769: 8.534336: The Haskell standard library is split into modules - each of them contains functions and types that are somehow related and serve some common purpose. There's a module for manipulating lists, a module for concurrent programming, a module for dealing with complex numbers, etc. All the functions, types and typeclasses that we've dealt with so far were part of the Prelude module, which is imported by default.
2082: 8.526224: They're all absurd! But the first is a statement of special relativity, and the other two are consequences of quantum mechanics (vacuum fluctuations and barrier tunneling, they're called). Like it or not, that's the way the world is. If you insist it's ridiculous, you'll be forever closed to some of the major findings on the rules that govern the Universe.
2406: 8.523651: What happens to a heart when love ends? Does it fade into a shadow of remorse when it bends? Or can it fly to the sky like a bird - lighter than ever, stronger too? Oh, I think a heart always learns to come through. Where do the teardrops go when they dry? Do they follow all the raindrops and return to the sky? Even a sparrow with broken wings looks to the sun and finds a song; oh, I think the heart always learns to be strong. Where did the sorrow go? Who gave me back the sun, I don't know! Opening my eyes, I see blue skies...
1800: 8.522477: Just a heads-up: that coffee we gave you earlier had fluorescent calcium in it so we can track the neuronal activity in your brain. There's a slight chance the calcium could harden and vitrify your frontal lobe. Anyway, don't stress yourself thinking about it. I'm serious. Visualizing the scenario while under stress actually triggers the reaction.
1503: 8.520877: Gotta change my answering machine now that I'm alone. 'Cause right now it says that we can't come to the phone. And I know it makes no sense 'cause you walked out the door. But it's the only way I hear your voice anymore. It's been months and for some reason I just can't get over us. And I'm stronger than this, yeah, enough is enough. No more walking 'round with my head down, I'm so over being blue, cryin' over you. And I'm so sick of love songs, so tired of tears. So done with wishin' you were still here. Said I'm so sick of love songs, so sad and slow. So why can't I turn off the radio?
1370: 8.519635: If you accept, your payment will be triple your current annual salary. Call the number on the card. Voice-matching will be used to ensure security. The supers aren't gone, Mr. Incredible. You're still here. You can still do great things. Or you can listen to police scanners. Your choice. You have 24 hours to respond. Think about it.
2081: 8.519109: Consider this claim: as I walk along, time - as measured by my wristwatch or my aging process - slows down. Also, I shrink in the direction of motion. Also, I get more massive. Who has ever witnessed such a thing? It's easy to dismiss it out of hand. Here's another: matter and antimatter are all the time, throughout the Universe, being created from nothing. Here's a third: once in a very great while, your car will spontaneously ooze through the brick wall of your garage and be found the next morning on the street.
2196: 8.515677: Miss you laughing. Miss you coming in from the cold or one too many meetings. Laughing. I'll order already. I'll order seven helpings, some dumplings, those cold yam noodles that you like. You can come in your light body or skeleton or be invisible; I don't even care. Know you have a long way to travel. Know I don't even know if it's long at all. Wish you could tell me. What you're reading. If you're reading. Miss you. I'm at the table in the back.
1442: 8.515359: Night howlers aren't wolves. They're flowers. The flowers are making the predators go savage. That's it! That's what I've been missing! Keys! Keys! Keys! Hurry! Come on! Thank you, I love you, bye!
1413: 8.505323: Beloved Bettys, your band is the biggest, baddest most bangin' buncha babes from Boston to Burbank. I've barely bathed since I began blogging about your bangin' beats. Your biggest Betty band fan, Candace.
1352: 8.493856: What are you doing? Take your hands off me! You can't arrest me! I hope you're happy, Sullivan! You've destroyed this company! Monsters Incorporated is dead! Where will everyone get their scream now? The energy crisis will only get worse! Because of you!
1978: 8.482729: "It is no longer needed comrade," said Squealer stiffly. "'Beasts of England' was the song of the Rebellion. But the Rebellion is now completed."
1369: 8.47265: Hello, Mr. Incredible. Yes, we know who you are. Rest assured, your secret is safe with us. My name is Mirage. We have something in common. According to the government, neither of us exist. Please pay attention, as this message is classified and will not be repeated. I represent a top secret division of the government, designing and testing experimental technology, and we have need of your unique abilities. Something has happened at our testing facility.
1590: 8.470286: For the audition, you will sing 16 bars of Kelly Clarkson's 'Since You've Been Gone'. If a group likes you, they will contact you directly. My tone-deaf sidekick, Justin here, will be collecting your information.
182: 8.469932: Well, what do you say? Would you like to be transmogrified? Don't be scared, the process is instantaneous and completely painless. Just think! With the push of a button, you could be a 500-story gastropod - a slug the size of the Chrysler building!
2025: 8.469665: Pirates are evil? The Marines are righteous? These terms have always changed throughout the course of history! Kids who have never seen peace and kids who have never seen war have different values! Those who stand at the top determine what's wrong and what's right! This very place is neutral ground! Justice will prevail, you say? But of course it will! Whoever wins this war becomes justice!
1585: 8.463333: I realize this moment may not be the most convenient for a heart-to-heart, but I had to wait until your friends were otherwise occupied. There was a time they cared nothing for Miss Vance. When their only experience of humanity was a crowbar coming at them down a steel corridor. When I plucked her from Black Mesa I acted in the face of objections that she was a mere child and of no practical use to anyone. I have learned to ignore such naysayers when quelling them was out of the question. Still I am not one to squander my investments and I remain confident she was worth far more than the initial appraisal.
1509: 8.461976: Now I've searched low and I've searched high, trying to find myself a cutie pie. But, destination leads me to a dead end, over and over and over again. They told me to wait, so I waited, anticipated, debated, and delayed it. But still came up with the same ol' thing, nothing. It seems as if every time I find the right girl she turns out to be the very wrong girl. Tell me y'all, when will this madness stop? I want somebody to love me for me, not because I'm MC Heavy D. I'm looking for a love that's as solid as a rock.
1278: 8.461912: The freedom of a country can only be measured by its respect for the rights of its citizens, and it's my conviction that these rights are in fact limitations of state power that define exactly where and when a government may not infringe into that domain of personal or individual freedoms that during the American Revolution was called "liberty" and during the Internet Revolution is called "privacy".
2383: 8.461696: A silver ring fish floated by them, undulating, and closing like an iris, instantly, around food particles, to assimilate them. Dad looked at it. His voice was deep and quiet. "Just like war. War swims along, sees food, contracts. A moment later - Earth is gone."
1883: 8.451869: Now I face out, I hold out, I reach out to the truth of my life seeking to seize on the whole moment. Yeah, naked truth lies only if you realize, appearing in nobody's eyes till they sterilize. Stop the guerrilla warfare to keep it fair, bro, change your rage to a smarter greater cause, you know the stake is high stardom is near. Those who sympathized, you die killers pass by. Do not waste your time in hating flirting guys. Use your might to AIs do justice to them all.
251: 8.450298: You shout it out, but I can't hear a word you say. I'm talking loud, not saying much. I'm criticized, but all your bullets ricochet. Shoot me down, but I get up. I'm bulletproof, nothing to lose. Fire away, fire away. Ricochet, you take your aim. Fire away, fire away.
29: 8.42597: It is those who are successful, in other words, who are most likely to be given the kinds of special opportunities that lead to further success. It's the rich who get the biggest tax breaks. It's the best students who get the best teaching and most attention. And it's the biggest nine and ten-year-olds who get the most coaching and practice. Success is the result of what sociologists like to call "accumulative advantage".
1263: 8.421109: Well... no, actually I'm stationed up in the Gamma Quadrant of Sector 4. As a member of the elite Universe Protection Unit of the Space Ranger Corps, I protect the galaxy from the threat of invasion from the Evil Emperor Zurg, sworn enemy of the Galactic Alliance.
51: 8.417287: We're no strangers to love. You know the rules and so do I. A full commitment's what I'm thinking of. You wouldn't get this from any other guy. I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling. Gotta make you understand. Never gonna give you up. Never gonna let you down. Never gonna run around and desert you. Never gonna make you cry. Never gonna say goodbye. Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you.
2026: 8.406367: I'm sorry, but I don't want to be an emperor. That's not my business. I don't want to rule or conquer anyone. I should like to help everyone if possible: Jew, Gentile, black man, white. We all want to help one another. Human beings are like that. We want to live by each other's happiness, not by each other's misery. We don't want to hate and despise one another. In this world there is room for everyone, and the good earth is rich and can provide for everyone. The way of life can be free and beautiful, but we have lost the way. Greed has poisoned men's souls...
1346: 8.394674: You're going in there because we need this. Our city is counting on you to collect those children's screams. Without scream, we have no power. Yes, it's dangerous work and that's why I need you to be at your best. I need scarers who are confident, tenacious, tough, intimidating. I need scarers like... like... James P. Sullivan.
2283: 8.39309: Some of the largest ocean waves in the world are nearly impossible to see. Unlike other large waves, these rollers, called internal waves, do not ride the ocean surface. Instead, they move underwater, undetectable without the use of satellite imagery or sophisticated monitoring equipment... and they can reach staggering heights - some as tall as skyscrapers.
233: 8.387507: What's it going to be then, eh? There was me, that is Alex, and my three droogs, that is Pete, Georgie, and Dim, Dim being really dim, and we sat in the Korova Milkbar making up our rassoodocks what to do with the evening, a flip chill winter bastard though dry.
2329: 8.383833: The entrepreneur and investor Naval Ravikant has said, "To write a great book, you must first become the book."
2234: 8.380734: Alright, close your eyes. I want you to think of a flower. Look at its contours, its curves. Now I want you to imagine it: changing, moving backwards, returning to its bud. Think of that bud, unopened. Look at it, as a whole, and silently repeat these phrases: "May you be free from suffering. May you be free from fear. May you know peace and joy."
1072: 8.377745: The massive folding door encompasses nearly one whole wall of the hangar. A push of a button sends power to a system of humming pulleys and cables that slowly, tediously raises the enormous barricade out of the way. You would normally see a private jet parked here, but today the hangar houses the cars left behind and mostly untouched after their owner, actor Paul Walker, died more than six years ago, in November 2013.
1519: 8.375437: Look, you see what's happening here man? Our team is coming apart because of your singing thing. Even the drama geeks and the brainiacs suddenly think they can... talk to us. Look, the skater dudes are mingling. Suddenly people think that they can do other stuff. Stuff that is not their stuff. They've got you thinking about show tunes when we've got a playoff game next week.
1669: 8.373267: Why are you so selfish? Your manner does not change. Why are you so foolish? Your very strange thought does not change. Do you think you're really right? You're a liar, I think so. You are looking at the other side. There is no answer, no! Go away from this place. Do not touch my thing. You don't know your business. I feel disgusted. You never reveal your intention. Can't put up with your manner, that's the limit. No more!
1647: 8.373175: In March 1989, one of Ghidi's uncles paid the equivalent of 50,000 Swedish kronor to the local leader of the Ba'ath Party, as compensation for the injury Ghidi had caused the Iraqi state.
1878: 8.373064: Eternal night, age of the dying light. Lights in the sky have been fading, winter winds of ice are coming. Prophecies told of a mage of the winter snow, wizard of blizzard, master of ice, wielding magical might. Long long ago, centuries past, he returns with fire and light. Storming through the skies, the stars falling on the night of winterlight. Soaring high above, white fields, frozen on the nights of winterlight. Rise through the ice and a new dawn will arise beyond the night of winterlight.
1289: 8.371506: Hydrogen is the chemical element with the symbol H and atomic number 1. With a standard atomic weight of 1.008, hydrogen is the lightest element in the periodic table. Hydrogen is the most abundant chemical substance in the universe, constituting roughly 75% of all baryonic mass.
1534: 8.370469: Easy come, easy go, that's just how you live. Take it all, but you never give. Shoulda known you was trouble from the first kiss. Had your eyes wide open, why were they open? Gave you all I had and you tossed it in the trash, you tossed it in the trash. To give me all your love is all I ever ask. 'Cause what you don't understand is I'd catch a grenade for ya. Throw my hand on a blade for ya. I'd jump in front of a train for ya. You know I'd do anything for ya. I would go through all this pain, take a bullet straight through my brain. Yes, I would die for ya, baby. But you won't do the same.
1618: 8.35395: Everybody's always talkin' at me, everybody's tryin' to get in my head. I wanna listen to my own heart talkin', I need to count on myself instead. Did you ever lose yourself to get what you want? Did you ever get on a ride then wanna get off? Did you ever push away the ones you shoulda held close? Did you ever let go, did you ever not know? I'm not gonna stop, that's who I am. I'll give it all I got, that is my plan. Will I find what I lost? You know you can. Bet on it, bet on it.
1773: 8.338042: Haskell's combination of purity, higher order functions, parameterized algebraic data types, and typeclasses allows us to implement polymorphism on a much higher level than possible in other languages. We don't have to think about types belonging to a big hierarchy of types. Instead, we think about what the types can act like and then connect them with the appropriate typeclasses.
2368: 8.336996: The pact is sealed! I shall destroy Billy Westlake for his insulting words about your mother! "No. I wish for him to stub his toe, and the day before it finally heals, he will stub it again. Over and over. Forever." ... Dang kid, I gotta write this one down.
1382: 8.335997: Shhhhh... The baby is sleeping. You took away my future. I'm simply returning the favor. Oh, don't worry, I'll be a good mentor. Supportive, encouraging. Everything that you weren't. And in time, who knows, he might make a good sidekick. Ha ha!
2213: 8.3316: I can hear you far away. I can see you in the distance. I am living for today; I go forth with no resistance. You're the castle in the skies. I'm an island on the ocean. Will we make it through the night - if we're guided by devotion? If we drift to the horizon; if we let it all go, then will you come with me - til' we are free? If we drift to the horizon and if we let it all go, then will you come with me? I'm gonna make it somehow; I'm gonna break through the clouds. I will make you mine. I'm gonna sing it out loud; I'm gonna drown in the sun. Will you leave me a sign?
1874: 8.329899: Vade retro, alter ego; move aside, I'm choking on this life. I think I tolerate your hate, as long as you're afraid. All I wanted was to be with you and suffer every day. Under the moon I hold, a wake for a promise torn. Mortally wounded, feelings sheltered me. Once again my shadow will enter your life. Time to walk with me the last mile! I read a book about a man, a love, a woman, how they died. How I was waved aside, listen how the headless doves cry. I truly see a madman in the mirror when I'm weak. I spent a year in love before I realized it's me!
77: 8.325931: These are cookies. This is not breakfast. You are eating cookies. Stop it! Stop eating cookies and go make yourself breakfast! Stop it! Don't eat one more cookie! Put that cookie down! Do not eat that cookie! I can't believe you ate that cookie!
1546: 8.32295: Physical wounds will definitely bleed and may look painful but over time they heal by themselves and if you apply medicine, they will heal faster. What's troublesome are wounds of the heart. Nothing is harder to heal. They're a bit different from physical injuries. You can't apply medicine for one thing and sometimes, they never heal. There's only one cure for a wound of the heart. It's a bit bothersome and you can only receive it from someone else. What is it? Love.
2121: 8.322759: When the violins drew out the first strain of the Pilgrim's chorus, my Aunt Georgiana clutched my coat-sleeve. Then it was that I first realized that for her this singing of basses and stinging frenzy of lighter strings broke a silence of thirty years, the inconceivable silence of the plains. With the battle between the two motifs, with the bitter frenzy of the Venusberg theme and its ripping of strings, came to me an overwhelming sense of the waste and wear we are so powerless to combat.
1507: 8.322016: I know this might seem strange, but let me know if I'm out of order for stepping to you this way. See, I've been watching you for a while and I just gotta let you know that I'm really feeling your style. 'Cause I have to know your name and leave you with my number, and I hope that you would call me someday. If you want, you can give me yours too and if you don't, I ain't mad at you. We can still be cool. I'm not trying to pressure you, just can't stop thinkin' 'bout you. You ain't even really gotta be my girlfriend. I just wanna know your name and maybe we can hook up, hang out, just chill.
1837: 8.3214445: Of course. Why else would one keep one's ancestors around? You think a man designed the first Guild ship? Your history books told you it was Aurelius Venport? They lied. It was his mistress, Norma. She gave him the design along with five children. He thought his ego would take no less. In the end, the knowledge that he had not really fulfilled his own image, that was what destroyed him.
1791: 8.319654: Good morning. You have been in suspension for FIFTY days. In compliance with state and federal regulations, all testing candidates in the Aperture Science Extended Relaxation Center must be revived periodically for a mandatory physical and mental wellness exercise.
1306: 8.316366: Well, well, well! Looks like you've got a choice to make, Stoppable! What's more important - Your sacred duty as assistant manager, or your pathetic role as goofy sidekick?
2263: 8.311857: This church had no walls, no ceiling, no altar, no stained glass windows. Granite outcroppings and boulders served as walls; tall pines were the support beams. The ceiling was the deep blue sky that canopied the highest ridge, the tallest tree. Instead of richly colored stained glass windows, we looked out on pine-covered ridges mounting one after another, each one higher, as if to touch the still hidden snowcaps we knew to be just beyond our line of vision.
2211: 8.306689: So many questions, but I'm talking to myself; I know that you can't hear me anymore. So much to tell you, and most of all, goodbye, but I know that you can't hear me anymore. The longer I stand here, the louder the silence. I know that you're gone, but sometimes I swear that I hear your voice when the wind blows; so I talk to the shadows, hoping you might be listening 'cause I want you to know: "It's so loud inside my head, with words that I should've said, and as I drown in my regrets, I can't take back the words I never said."
1662: 8.29934: Yes, I am a soldier, promise I'll always fight in the cause of justice. But I don't do it by order, I'm always an enemy to injustice. Voices crying in the wilderness, somebody is asking for my help. Rise against! Out loud! Show you my noble action. Win or lose to be proud. I'll prove my devotion. With a rage like a shroud. I'm ready for action, feel my riot of emotion. I only fight in the cause of justice. I am an enemy to injustice.
116: 8.2978325: For several days ensuing, her name was unmentioned by either Usher or myself: and during this period I was busied in earnest endeavours to alleviate the melancholy of my friend. We painted and read together; or I listened, as if in a dream, to the wild improvisations of his speaking guitar. And thus, as a closer and still intimacy admitted me more unreservedly into the recesses of his spirit, the more bitterly did I perceive the futility of all attempt at cheering a mind from which darkness, as if an inherent positive quality, poured forth upon all objects of the moral and physical universe, in one unceasing radiation of gloom.
965: 8.2972975: Awarded the National Medal of Science, the highest honor for scientific achievement in this country, revered biochemist Earl Stadtman was quoted as saying, "Aging is a disease."
1894: 8.288157: I try to enter deep inside and devour everything. All I need is power to take control till destroying. To see the light of the seven signs and reach the prophecy. All I feel is anger inside to take control till destroying. To break down till the end. Just hide away into your mind, there is no place for me to die. Call me invincible spy, fear and panic everywhere. You can pass away, I'll keep your soul and all remains. I'm vicious caller, tears and chaos everywhere, end is not so far away.
1254: 8.2807455: Ah, how shall I do it? Oh, I know. I'll turn him into a flea, a harmless, little flea, and then I'll put that flea in a box, and then I'll put that box inside of another box, and then I'll mail that box to myself, and when it arrives... I'll smash it with a hammer! It's brilliant, brilliant, brilliant, I tell you! Genius, I say! Or, to save on postage, I'll just poison him with this.
1264: 8.278295: Couldn't handle Buzz cutting on your playtime, could you Woody? Didn't wanna face the fact that Buzz might be Andy's new favorite toy. So you got rid of him. Well what if Andy starts playing with me more Woody, huh? You gonna knock me out the window too?
1653: 8.27615: Without love, without truth, there can be no turning back. Without faith, without hope, there can be no peace of mind. As the night went on, I started to find my way. I learned about a tragedy, a mystery still today. I tried to get more answers, but he said, "You're on your own". Then he turned away and left me as I stood there all alone. He said, "You'll know the truth as your future days unfold".
1860: 8.2695465: But look, you found the notice, didn't you? "Yes," said Arthur, "yes I did. It was on display in the bottom of a locked filing cabinet stuck in a disused lavatory with a sign on the door saying 'Beware of the Leopard.'"
1823: 8.264173: Don't touch anything else. Don't even look at anything else, just - well obviously you've got to look at everything else to find "escape pod", but as soon as you've looked at something and it doesn't say "escape pod", look at something else, look at the next thing. Alright?
1182: 8.26084: You're too good to feel this bad about yourself. I know that, and you should know that. You have true courage and a big heart. I've seen you get knocked down so many times before, and every single time, you get up again. That's real strength. And... and you're ten times funnier than any human I know. See? See, you know you're amazing. You're smart, and fast, and beautiful. Rayla, you're the most amazing person I've ever met.
1443: 8.260687: Wait, listen! I... I know you'll never forgive me. And I don't blame you. I wouldn't forgive me either. I was ignorant and irresponsible and small-minded. But predators shouldn't suffer because of my mistakes. I have to fix this, but I can't do it without you. And after we're done... you can hate me. And that'll be fine, because I was a horrible friend, and I hurt you, and you- and you can walk away knowing that you were right all along. I really am just a dumb bunny.
1422: 8.258036: Remind me, why did we put spikes on Buford's chariot again? And a bowling ball catapult? I mean, what were we thinking? Why'd we give them all the cool stuff? What do we have? Cup holders?! Sweet! Now we're cooking.
398: 8.257388: There will be no foolish wand-waving or silly incantations in this class. As such, I don't expect many of you to appreciate the subtle science and exact art that is potion-making. However, for those select few who possess the predisposition, I can teach you how to bewitch the mind and ensnare the senses. I can tell you how to bottle fame, brew glory, and even put a stopper in death. Then again, maybe some of you have come to Hogwarts in possession of abilities so formidable that you feel confident enough to not pay attention!
114: 8.2573395: And my friend said, "I know you love her, but it's over, mate. It doesn't matter, put the phone away. It's never easy to walk away, let her go. It'll be okay. It's gonna hurt for a bit of time. So bottoms up, let's forget tonight. You'll find another and you'll be just fine, let her go. It'll be alright".
1279: 8.25133: According to Maryland Criminal Law Section 10-501, adultery is illegal and punishable by a $10 fine.
1395: 8.250661: A platypus? Perry the Platypus? You are mine now! No, that was the garage door opener. You are mine now! And that was the TV remote. You are mine now! Now I shall finally rid myself of you! But first, pay your attention to the giant screen and- Maybe I need to turn the cable on first?
170: 8.248709: I stood on tiptoe, hastily looked around once more, reached into the hole, and withdrew two pieces of chewing gum minus their outer wrappers. My first impulse was to get it into my mouth as quickly as possible, but I remembered where I was. I ran home, and on our front porch I examined my loot. The gum looked fresh. I sniffed it and it smelled all right. I licked it and waited for a while. When I did not die I crammed it into my mouth: Wrigley's Double-Mint.
1899: 8.2456875: Hiding in the fog where darkness meets the moonlight I will sing a melody till the morning comes. Living for you only, take my hand and show me. There will be much sorrow when the morning comes. Fearless I'm fighting the pain burns inside of me; find the forces of my soul. No one can understand me, am I condemned to ride the blackest night alone? Tragic painting on the walls. In this castle where affliction reigns so many died in vain, hear their distant cries. Never again!
1740: 8.243148: In Python, single-quoted strings and double-quoted strings are the same. This PEP does not make a recommendation for this. Pick a rule and stick to it. When a string contains single or double quote characters, however, use the other one to avoid backslashes in the string. It improves readability.
2206: 8.239615: It's a bit counterintuitive, yet imposing constraints (with intention) can actually increase creative potential. Think of as many silver things as you can in ten seconds. Now think of silver things in your kitchen. Which prompt sparked more ideas?
1497: 8.23425: Let's get down to business, to defeat the Huns. Did they send me daughters when I asked for sons? You're the saddest bunch I ever met. But you can bet, before we're through Mister, I'll make a man out of you. Tranquil as a forest, but on fire within. Once you find your center, you are sure to win. You're a spineless, pale, pathetic lot and you haven't got a clue. Somehow, I'll make a man out of you.
2027: 8.234058: First, let no one rule your mind or body. Take special care that your thoughts remain unfettered... Give men your ear, but not your heart. Show respect for those in power, but don't follow them blindly. Judge with logic and reason, but comment not. Consider none your superior whatever their rank or station in life. Treat all fairly, or they will seek revenge. Be careful with your money. Hold fast to your beliefs and others will listen.
1858: 8.232818: "But," says Man, "the Babel fish is a dead giveaway isn't it? It could not have evolved by chance. It proves you exist, and therefore, by your own arguments, you don't. QED."
80: 8.232522: When the police arrived and found no lion, no broken wall, and no convicts, and the Head behaving like a lunatic, there was an inquiry into the whole thing. And in the inquiry all sorts of things about Experiment House came out, and about ten people got expelled. After that, the Head's friends saw that the Head was no use as a Head, so they got her made an Inspector to interfere with other Heads. And when they found she wasn't much good even at that, they got her into Parliament where she lived happily ever after.
1435: 8.231847: We belong together and you know that I'm right. Why do you play with my heart, why do you play with my mind? Said we'd be forever, said it'd never die. How could you love me and leave me and never say goodbye? When I can't sleep at night without holding you tight. Girl, each time I try I just break down and cry. Pain in my head, oh, I'd rather be dead. Spinnin' around and around. Although we've come to the end of the road, still I can't let go. It's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you.
1492: 8.219677: Go get her! What's the matter with you? After this Great Stone Humptey Dumptey mess, I'd have to bring her home with a medal to get back in the Temple! Wait a minute! That's it! I make Mulan a war hero, and they'll be begging me to come back to work! That's the master plan! Oh, you've done it now, man.
1405: 8.215598: Hi, I'm Candace. I'm sure you recognize me from my countless magazine covers. You know, being a supermodel is hard work: the bright lights, the deafening applause, and all those paper cuts from counting my huge stacks of money. That's why I start every morning with Candace-O's.
1677: 8.213998: Close your eyes and begin to relax, take a deep breath and let it out slowly. Concentrate on your breathing, with each breath you become more relaxed. Imagine a brilliant white light above you, focus in on this light as it flows through your body. Allow yourself to drift off as you fall deeper and deeper into a more relaxed state of mind. Now as I count back from ten to one you will feel more peaceful and calm. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six. You will enter a safe place where nothing can harm you. Five, four, three, two. If at any time you need to come back all you must do is open your eyes. One.
1362: 8.212007: In a stunning turn of events, a superhero is being sued for saving someone who, apparently, didn't want to be saved. The plaintiff, Oliver Sansweet, who was foiled in his attempted suicide by Mr. Incredible, has filed a suit against the famed superhero in Superior Court.
97: 8.20893: Welcome to 'Visions of Nature'. This room has several paintings in it. Some are big, some are small. People did them and they're here now. I believe that after this is over, they'll be hung in government buildings. Why the government is involved in an art show is beyond me. I also think it's pointless for a human to paint scenes of nature when they could just go outside and stand in it. Anyway, please do not misinterpret the fact that I am talking right now as genuine interest in art and attempt to discuss it with me further. End of speech.
2384: 8.204608: There will come soft rains and the smell of the ground, and swallows with their shimmering sound; And frogs in the pools singing at night, and wild plum trees in tremulous white; Robins will wear their feathery fire, whistling their whims on a low fence-wire; And not one will know of the war, not one will care at last when it is done. Not one would mind, neither bird nor tree, if mankind perished utterly; And Spring herself, when she woke at dawn would scarcely know that we were gone.
1408: 8.199998: Ah, Perry the Platypus. As usual, your timing is uncanny. And by uncanny, I mean, "completely" canny!!
2184: 8.198665: With that, Luma, trailing bands of white, soared high into the sky and just as quickly started to plummet back down. KABOOM! KABLAM! The ground shook, and a bright light poured out of the crater that the Luma had created.
1260: 8.194509: Local law enforcement! It's about time you got here. I'm Buzz Lightyear, Space Ranger, Universe Protection Unit. My ship has crash-landed here by mistake.
1569: 8.191678: I don't patronize, I realize, I'm losing and this is my real life. I am half asleep, and I am wide awake. This habit is always so hard to break. I don't want to be the bad guy, I've been blaming myself and I think you know why. I'm killing time and time's killing you every way that I do. Did you say, "Please just follow me"? I thought you wanted me 'cause I want you all to myself. I can try and suck it up, I just can't suck it up. Make me feel like some one else.
2357: 8.191396: I think I'm going to return. If I do, I don't believe I will take the truth with me. I will not forget it, but I will surely leave it behind. I believe it, don't I? I could do the job better than that god. But, I will need hands again for it first. I shouldn't simply think or talk that I might be better. I'll do it. I will. But really... I am not swelling with pride as I escape here. Instead, take this as revenge. I'll change the world, or craft a better one. You've left this one broken so badly. Isn't anything possible? I think so. No... I know it.
1363: 8.190308: Mr. Sansweet didn't ask to be saved, Mr. Sansweet didn't want to be saved! And the injury received from Mr. Incredible's "action", so quote, causes him daily pain!
1365: 8.190181: I hid a camera. And this time I got him. See? You see? You don't see it? He moves! Right there! Wait, wait! Right... there! Right as I'm sitting down! I don't know how he does it, but there's no tack on my stool before he moves and after he moves, there's a tack! Coincidence? I think not!
1805: 8.185901: Now, if you're part of Control Group Kepler-Seven, we implanted a tiny microchip about the size of a postcard into your skull. Most likely you've forgotten it's even there, but if it starts vibrating and beeping during this next test, let us know, because that means it's about to hit five hundred degrees, so we're gonna need to go ahead and get that out of you pretty fast.
1433: 8.183817: In computing, source code is any collection of code, with or without comments, written using a human-readable programming language, usually as plain text. The source code of a program is specially designed to facilitate the work of computer programmers, who specify the actions to be performed by a computer mostly by writing source code. The source code is often transformed by an assembler or compiler into binary machine code that can be executed by the computer.
1512: 8.172222: It's undeniable that we should be together. It's unbelievable how I used to say that I'd fall never. The basis is need to know if you don't know just how I feel. Then let me show you now that I'm for real. If all things in time, time will reveal. One, you're like a dream come true. Two, just wanna be with you. Three, girl, it's plain to see that you're the only one for me. And four, repeat steps one through three. Five, make you fall in love with me. If ever I believe my work is done, then I start back at one.
1793: 8.164828: Well, well, well. Welcome TO MY LAIR! Lemme just flag something up: according to the control panel light up there, the entire building's going to self-destruct in about six minutes. Pretty sure it's a problem with the light. I think the light's on the blink. But just in case it isn't, I actually am going to have to kill you. As discussed earlier.
107: 8.157926: It was a dark and stormy night; the rain fell in torrents - except at occasional intervals, when it was checked by a violent gust of wind which swept up the streets (for it is in London that our scene lies), rattling along the housetops, and fiercely agitating the scanty flame of the lamps that struggled against the darkness.
1652: 8.154095: Alone at night, I feel so strange. I need to find all the answers to my dreams. When I sleep at night, I hear the cries. What does this mean? I shut the door and traveled to another home, I met an older man, he seemed to be alone. I felt that I could trust him, he talked to me that night. "Lad did you know a girl was murdered here? This fatal tragedy was talked about for years." Victoria's gone forever, only memories remain. She passed away, she was so young.
2355: 8.149675: She witnesses her empty palm. She glances at Charon, who, as ever, says nothing. ...But she sets her shoulders. ...She is the master, after all. She looks at her staring servant, and asks... "...Shall we go and see the end?"
81: 8.148738: We tend to think that we are happier if we take things into our own hands. The opposite is true: Simona Botti from Cornell University has shown in experiments that when we make our own decisions we suffer nagging doubt that we didn't make the best choice. However, if another person decides for us, or if we toss a coin, we are either grateful or - if the outcome is bad - can blame someone else.
2125: 8.146265: The day I opened up memory's door, I found something that I could live for. Curtains shook my eyes and light came rushing inside. Data behind my heart's encryption key - listen and you might hear a melody. Your fire sparked the passion that keeps burning: magic that helps me to believe. All the colors of the night and the way they help you hide; I'm learning what it's like to love and be alive. Oh, there will always be a tomorrow; you'll never have to be alone!
2046: 8.141221: You know, we always called each other good fellas. Like you said to, uh, somebody, "You're gonna like this guy. He's all right. He's a good fella. He's one of us." You understand? We were good fellas. Wise guys.
1296: 8.140452: Mike, I don't know a single scarer who can do what you do. I know everyone sees us together, they think I'm the one running the show, but the truth is... I've been riding your coattails since day one! You made the deal with Hardscrabble. You took a hopeless team, and made them champions. All I did was catch a pig!
1315: 8.140448: Ah, it went to voice mail! Um, hello, Shego, Dr. Drakken. I hope you're having a nice vacation. Uh, when you get the chance, could you get up here to the North Pole and save me?! Please! It's cold and windy and dark, and we've got nothing to...!
1725: 8.135209: There was value in the thing. Clearly. Of that they were certain of. But what is the application? In a matter of hours they had pinned it to everything from mass transit to satellite launching. Imagining devices the size of jumbo jets. Everything would be cheaper, it was practical, and they knew it. But above all that, beyond the positives... they knew that the easiest way to be exploited is to sell something they did not yet understand. So they kept quiet.
1470: 8.133768: Wrong! Viruses do not stop! Once those Cy-Bugs finish off Sugar Rush, they'll invade every other game until this arcade is nothing but a smoking husk of forgotten dreams. Kohut, my cruiser!
2264: 8.130928: To this day, I cannot sing those old familiar hymns without bringing all my senses into play. Somewhere I hear the wheezing, gasping sounds of that decrepit organ. I conjure up the fragrance of Ponderosa pine. I feel the mountain wind stirring my hair. And in my mind's eye I see the faces of the friends of my youth. The memories from a mere 30 Sundays, spread over six summers out of a lifetime, reach across the years and are as vivid to me now as the last time I worshiped on that hill far away.
1424: 8.130463: Hmm, that's funny. I don't remember you saying "spec" so many times. Dr. Wexler, you're a platypus. Perry the Platypus?! I want to say I knew it was you, but I can't, because I didn't.
1815: 8.129282: This next test involves the Aperture Science Aerial Faith Plate. It was part of an initiative to investigate how well test subjects could solve problems when they were catapulted into space. Results were highly informative: they could not. Good luck!
1901: 8.128701: When the night meets the day, I'll be watchin' the red sky. Hear the whisper of wind, take a power that never end. History tells a lie: we don't believe in the Darkest Age. Change the time of the gloom; we just fight for the freedom. From the past I'm hearing there is a voice that's calling me. Just feel the fire it's never end. On through the night, we are striding on and on. Hear your voices, spreading your wings and fly away. I just feel your power of the steel, so I'll never die in the heat. I just feel your power of the steel, so I'll never die.
2043: 8.1271105: It's all right. You won't be alone. You have Bolt. I've altered him. (Bolt is being experimented on to make him stronger, faster, and more powerful, unlike any other dog. A lightning bolt appears on his flank.) He can protect you now.
1614: 8.126455: I know everybody on this island seems so happy on this island. Everything is by design. I know everybody on this island has a role on this island. So maybe I can roll with mine. I can lead with pride, I can make us strong, I'll be satisfied if I play along. But, the voice inside sings a different song, what is wrong with me? See the light as it shines on the sea? It's blinding. But no one knows, how deep it goes. And it seems like it's calling out to me, so come find me, and let me know. What's beyond that line, will I cross that line?
2100: 8.122655: In the metaphysics of identity, the ship of Theseus is a thought experiment that raises the question of whether an object that has had all of its components replaced remains fundamentally the same object. The concept is one of the oldest in Western philosophy, having been discussed by Heraclitus and Plato by 500 - 400 BC.
1530: 8.121122: In my first go at life, I was a healer... Exactly as the name implies, I revive and heal the injured. However, there was a fatal drawback to healing. I see all the experiences of the people I heal stream in front of me in an instant. There was unimaginable fear and suffering, things that couldn't be endured with a sane mind. Truthfully, I ran away countless times because I didn't want to use my healing powers. But no matter how many times I escaped, I always ended up getting caught again.
2009: 8.119744: After much choking, during which his various chins turned purple, he managed to get out: 'If you have your lower animals to contend with,' he said, 'we have our lower classes!' This bon mot set the table in a roar; and Mr Pilkington once again congratulated the pigs on the low rations, the long working-hours and the general absence of pampering which he had observed on Animal Farm.
2217: 8.11945: Listen to me, Woodrow. When a soldier goes into war he must go believing he is never coming back. This is why the Japanese are such courageous warriors. They are prepared to die. They expect nothing else. But to do that, you must believe in what you're fighting for. If you are not willing to die, you won't fight well. And if you don't fight well you will probably be killed stupidly, for the wrong reason, and unheroically.
1491: 8.116059: Citizens! I bring a proclamation from the Imperial City! The Huns have invaded China! By order of the Emperor, one man from every family must serve in the Imperial Army. The Hsiao Family! The Yi Family!
1897: 8.115573: Ride from the mountains and rise from the seas. Steel of the warriors, you bow to your knees. Sail through the darkness, the true prophecy. Cursed is the night in the sea of dreams. A blaze of light beyond the eastern sky. The stairs of doom towards the ivory tower. A vengeful death that waits for all this time. The judgement has passed, we all now die. A mess of torment for a thousand souls. The unseen fury of the ancient scrolls. The years of torture that have been foretold. A lifetime of fear, they now behold.
2066: 8.109978: Do not stand at my grave and weep. I am not there, I do not sleep. I am a thousand winds that blow; I am the diamond glints on the snow. I am the sunlight on ripened grain; I am the gentle autumn's rain. When you awaken in the morning's hush, I am the swift uplifting rush (of quiet birds in circled flight). I am the soft star that shines at night. Do not stand at my grave and cry. I am not there; I did not die.
2193: 8.107819: I watched her for a moment and she said he was sure he couldn't pay more than seventeen fifty for that china. She reached into the red velvet case, took out a dinner plate and hurled it at the floor right in front of his feet... Mama took out another dinner plate and hurled it at the floor, then another and another, never moving, never opening her mouth, just quivering and glaring at the retreating dealer, with tears streaming down her cheeks... When he was gone she stood there smashing cups and bowls and platters until the whole set lay in scattered blue and white fragments across the wooden floor.
2332: 8.103395: If you can get 1% better each day for one year, you'll end up 37 times better by the time you're done. Conversely, if you get 1% worse each day for one year, you'll decline nearly down to zero. What starts as a small win or a minor setback accumulates into something much more.
1674: 8.100162: All wound up, on the edge, terrified, sleep disturbed, restless mind, petrified. Bouts of fear permeate all I see, heightening nervousness threatens me. I am paralyzed, so afraid to die. Caught off guard, warning signs never show. Tension strikes, choking me, worries grow.
2278: 8.092286: Mr. Peters straightened his tie self-consciously and when Irma handed him a menu, he gestured with it so that the two women at the next table would notice the diamond ring on the fourth finger of his right hand. Both of these things, and also the fact that his hands showed signs of the manicurist, one can blame on the young man who had his picture taken with a derby hat on the back of his head. The young man had never for one second deserted Mr. Peters. He was always there, tugging at Mr. Peters' elbow, making him do things that were not becoming of a man of forty-five.
267: 8.09227: The roots will heal in time... as will the entire world. The sacrifices have been made. Just as the orcs, humans, and night elves discarded their old hatreds and stood united against a common foe, so did nature herself rise up to banish the Shadow forever. As for me, I came back to ensure that there would be a future, to teach the world that it no longer needed Guardians. The hope for future generations has always resided in mortal hands. And now that my task is done, I will take my place amongst the legends of the past.
1343: 8.0837555: Thank you, Arnold, for bringing this very serious issue to our attention. Now, people, one of our own classmates is in trouble and it's up to us to help her through her crisis. I think we should all go over to Phoebe's after school and tell her that she has nothing to be embarrassed about. I think we should tell her that we love her and care for her and if she comes back to school, we'll all forget about her little incident and never talk about it again! What do you say?! Okay, if we pull this off, then tomorrow's Movie Day.
953: 8.078207: Some care is needed in using Descartes' argument. "I think, therefore I am" says rather more than is strictly certain. It might seem as though we are quite sure of being the same person to-day as we were yesterday, and this is no doubt true in some sense. But the real Self is as hard to arrive at as the real table, and does not seem to have that absolute, convincing certainty that belongs to particular experiences.
1876: 8.07484: Strawberry blonde, your stranglehold on my heart is bound to end. I suppose, life sometimes, it doesn't go the way it was meant. Though you never were a believer, I assure you - I won't die before you. You read the book now, the part: Ashes to ashes, dust to dust. Short is the fight of this little starling. Love sounds familiar, but the emotion escapes me. I will carpe the diem while it's still here. And see how the fear of death becomes her.
1537: 8.067408: I've made mistakes. I could have treated you better. I let you get away. There goes my happily ever after. Tell me why, why can't we try and start again? This can't be how our story ends. You're more than my girl, you're my best friend. Tell me you remember when, when I was your man and you were my girl. It was you and me against the world. Baby, ain't nobody gonna love me like the way you do and you ain't never gonna find a love like mine. Tell me what can I do to make it up to you? 'Cause what we got's too good to say goodbye.
1604: 8.061826: Maui. When he stole from the Mother Island, darkness fell. Te Ka awoke. Monsters lurked and boats stopped coming back. To protect our people, the ancient chiefs forbid voyaging. And now we have forgotten who we are. And the darkness has continued to spread, chasing away our fish, draining the life from island after island.
54: 8.060923: When the comet last came, my grandfather, Fire Lord Sozin, used it to wipe out the Air Nomads. Now, I will use its power to end the Earth Kingdom... permanently. From our airships, we will rain fire over their lands, a fire that will destroy everything; and out of the ashes, a new world will be born, a world in which all the lands are Fire Nation and I am the supreme ruler of everything!
1624: 8.057101: Yeah, yeah. I'm fine, Buzz. Okay. Here's your list of things to do while I'm gone: batteries need to be changed. Toys at the bottom of the chest need to be rotated. Oh, and make sure everyone attends Mr. Spell's seminar on what to do if you or part of you is swallowed. Okay? Okay. Good, okay.
1295: 8.049275: Water. Earth. Fire. Air. My grandmother used to tell me stories about the old days, a time of peace when the Avatar kept balance between the Water Tribes, Earth Kingdom, Fire Nation, and Air Nomads. But it all changed when the Fire Nation attacked.
1896: 8.038939: From the dark, we walk to the light. From the shadows we learn to survive. When there's nothing to hide we will find what comes next after light. Destroy, rebuild, now, now, destroy, rebuild, now, now. I hear the angels sing but I hear the demons louder. Destruction chasing me, pulling me under. Pulling me under now, I'm dying to get out. We will never be the same again. From the dark we walk to the light from the shadows we learn to survive when there's nothing to hide we will find what comes next after light.
2276: 8.037315: The history book, which he propped against the catsup and the glass sugar bowl, had been used by others before him. Blank pages front and back were filled in with maps, drawings, dates, comic cartoons, and organs of the body; also with names and messages no longer clear and never absolutely legible. On nearly every other page there was some marginal notation, either in ink or in very hard pencil. And unless someone had upset a glass of water, the marks on page 177 were from tears.
1657: 8.036648: Now that you can see all you have done. That where there is despair, I may bring hope. That where there are shadows, I may bring light. It's time to take that step into the kingdom. That where there is sadness, I may bring joy. All your sins will help to make you strong. That I may seek rather to comfort, than to be comforted. That I may seek to understand than to be understood. And help you break right through the prison wall. That I may seek to love, rather than to be loved. For it is by self-forgetting that one finds, it is by forgiving that one is forgiven.
2277: 8.035838: Time is probably no more unkind to sporting characters than it is to other people, but physical decay unsustained by respectability is somehow more noticeable. Mr. Peters' hair was turning gray and his scalp showed through on top. He had lost weight also; he no longer filled out his clothes the way he used to. His color was poor, and the flower had disappeared from his buttonhole. In its place was an American Legion button.
1790: 8.032937: Just a heads up: we're gonna have a superconductor turned up full blast and pointed at you for the duration of this next test. I'll be honest, we're throwing science at the wall here to see what sticks. No idea what it'll do. Probably nothing. Best-case scenario, you might get some superpowers. Worst case, some tumors, which we'll cut out.
1505: 8.028371: Cause she walk like a boss, talk like a boss, manicured nails to set the pedicure off. She's fly effortlessly. And she move like a boss, do what a boss do. She got me thinking about getting involved. That's the kinda girl I need. She got her own thing, that's why I love her. Miss Independent, won't you come and spend a little time?
902: 8.0227375: If your enemy is secure at all points, be prepared for him. If he is in superior strength, evade him. If your opponent is temperamental, seek to irritate him. Pretend to be weak, that he may grow arrogant. If he is taking his ease, give him no rest. If his forces are united, separate them. If sovereign and subject are in accord, put division between them. Attack him where he is unprepared, appear where you are not expected.
1371: 8.019613: The Omnidroid's defenses necessitate an air drop from 5000 feet. Its cloaking devices make it difficult to track. Although we're pretty sure it's on the southern half of the island. One more thing. Obviously it represents a significant investment.
2268: 8.012501: Even in a book of lies sometimes you find truth. There is indeed a season for all things and now that I see you flesh-to-flesh and blood-to-blood I know I cannot raise my hand against you. But know this, you are my greatest disappointment. Does your master hear me? Atlas! You can kill me, but you will never have my city. My strength is not in steel and fire, that is what the parasites will never understand. A season for all things! A time to live and a time to die, a time to build... and a time to destroy!
1403: 8.012244: Agent P, Dr. Doofenshmirtz is up to his old tricks. He's made fifty-seven phone calls in the past hour. We don't know to whom or why. No, not to Santa!
2144: 8.011358: As the CSX case demonstrated, all the injured and families of the dead except Angelica Palank accepted their modest settlements quickly. So long as insurance costs less than repairs, this dangerous tradeoff will continue no matter what the railroad industry says about its safety.
2321: 8.011339: Sleep supports memory consolidation. In one experiment, students who learned material in a study/sleep/restudy condition remembered material better both a week and six months later than those who studied in the morning and restudied in the evening without intervening sleep.
1783: 8.008516: Good news is, the lab boys say the symptoms of asbestos poisoning show a median latency of forty-four point six years. So if you're thirty or older, you're laughing. Worst case scenario you miss out on a few rounds of canasta. Plus you forwarded the cause of science by three centuries. I punch those numbers into my calculator, it makes a happy face.
1111: 8.002073: I was confronted by a world that I could see and touch but didn't know how to talk about. There were so many words and names that I just didn't have. Flowers, trees, birds, reptiles, organs. The words you learn as you grow up in a country the ones the language reserves for people who are immersed in it and denies to those who just dip their toes in every now and then. The words for Saturday-afternoon strolls and summer camps and weekends in the country. Words from peaceful lives, lives that belong to the people living them.
1970: 8.001216: "Ah, that is different!" said Boxer. "If Comrade Napoleon says it, it must be right."
2402: 7.997525: The shift in our relationship to the natural world is startling, even in settings that one would assume are devoted to nature. Not that long ago, summer camp was a place where you camped, hiked in the woods, learned about plants and animals, or told firelight stories about ghosts or mountain lions. As likely as not today, "summer camp" is a weight-loss camp, or a computer camp.
109: 7.9953084: Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the western spiral arm of the Galaxy lies a small disregarded yellow sun. Orbiting this at a distance of roughly ninety-two million miles is an utterly insignificant little blue green planet whose ape-descended life forms are so amazingly primitive that they still think digital watches are a pretty neat idea.
2377: 7.994206: Who are we, anyway? The majority? Is that the answer? The majority is always holy, is it now? Always, always; just never wrong for one little insignificant tiny moment, is it? Never ever wrong in ten million years? He thought: What is this majority and who are in it? And what do they think and how did they get that way and will they ever change and how the devil did I get caught in this rotten majority?
2261: 7.981343: It happened during the procession at a parish church in Ontario, Canada. As the choir moved in perfect unison to the hymn, the last young lady slipped her stiletto heel into the grating over a hot air duct in the center of the aisle. The first man following her noticed the situation, and without skipping a beat, reached down and swooped up the shoe. The entire grating came with it. Startled, but still singing, the man marched on, carrying in his hand the shoe with the grating attached. There was never a break in the procession and right in time to the beat, the next man fell into the open duct.
2106: 7.9809823: Beyond the limited scope of his political experience he was "almost unbelievably ill-informed," as William Allen White put it. It was revealed even more clearly in his helplessness when confronted by questions of policy to which mere good nature could not find the answer.
244: 7.9802647: Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important tool I've ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Because almost everything - all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure - these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important. Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.
1842: 7.9797454: Yes! It is I who is onto you, Old Carl. No one is smarter than the Computer Master! I'm always watching, and I'm always thinking. My brain is much larger than Cheryl's brain. She was a fool for letting me go. But now, I will have my ultimate revenge!
2202: 7.9772954: This is our gamble: minute by minute, city after city, from the tense beginning to the jubilant or scattered end of every protest, with every rhythmic word of every chant, at each blocked entrance, each barricade, with every defiant inch forward, every move toward freedom for our people, any time we raise a fist or a song to mean we're never going away, in every confrontation, up and down the length of the stand-off, each and every time, we are testing the humanity of people who wear a badge, carry a gun, and fear our incomprehensible strength.
2403: 7.9767427: Our society is teaching young people to avoid direct experience in nature. That lesson is delivered in schools, families, even organizations devoted to the outdoors, and codified into the legal and regulatory structures of many of our communities. Our institutions... unconsciously associate nature with doom - while disassociating the outdoors from joy and solitude.
1109: 7.9763093: Milkman is a dynamic character whose growth Morrison charts by illustrating his progressive awareness of the landscapes he moves within. Scenes that immerse Milkman in unfamiliar territory, that show him struggling as an uninitiated visitor to sylvan lands, are reminiscent of literature in the American naturalist tradition.
2282: 7.9752336: According to one theory, the wisdom of the crowd still holds - measuring the aggregate of people's opinions produces a stable, reliable value. Skeptics, however, argue that people's opinions are easily swayed by those of others. So nudging a crowd early on by presenting contrary opinions - for example, exposing them to some very good or very bad attitudes - will steer the crowd in a different direction.
2297: 7.9744654: To her, it looks absolutely beautiful. A smile crosses her lips without her wanting. "How pleasant," she whispers, chuckling to herself. Something so beautiful here: where she could soon find her grave. It's so bizarre that it is... to laugh.
91: 7.9709926: What is a country? A country is a piece of land surrounded on all sides by boundaries, usually unnatural. Englishmen are dying for England, Americans are dying for America, Germans are dying for Germany, Russians are dying for Russia. There are now fifty or sixty countries fighting in this war. Surely so many countries can't all be worth dying for.
53: 7.968733: Two lovers, forbidden from one another, the war divides their people and the mountain divides them apart! Built a path to be together! Yeah, I forget the next couple of lines, but then it goes... Secret tunnel! Secret tunnel! Through the mountains, secret, secret, secret, secret tunnel! Yeah!
1567: 7.9651012: For as long as I could remember, I've done everything in my power to live a productive life that allows me to pursue a lasting inner peace. This may be a foreign concept, but I choose not to concern myself with winning or losing, life's troubles, or enemies who bring sleepless nights. That is how I cope with this backwards life we find ourselves living. It's what brings me happiness in a world fraught with hardship and misery. Of course, if I were ever to engage in combat, I would win the battle without question.
150: 7.961244: There's a word like overprotective to describe some parents, but no word that means the opposite. What word do you use to describe parents who don't protect enough? Underprotective? Neglectful? Self-involved? Lame? All of the above.
1822: 7.953356: Just thinking back to the old days when we were friends. Good old friends. Not enemies. And I'd say something like "come back", and you'd be like "no problem!" And you'd come back. What happened to those days?
2353: 7.948896: I'm in a foreign state; my thoughts, they slip away. My words are leaving me; they caught an aeroplane because I thought of you - just for the thought of you. Oh lights go down! In the moment, we're lost and found. I just wanna be by your side. If these wings could fly! Oh, curse these walls. In the moment, we're ten feet tall; and how you told me after it all, we'd remember tonight - for the rest of our lives. If these wings could fly...
2092: 7.948872: There are two things that you have to achieve before you can start getting to respectable speeds. First, know the locations of the keys by memory. I'm talking about not looking at your keyboard or any other reference image while you're typing. You should be able to remember the general location of every key after a moment of thought. Second, know the locations of the keys without having to think about it. This means committing the locations of the keys to muscle memory. You shouldn't have to actively think about where any of the letters are - your fingers should know where to go automatically.
2240: 7.9455347: White stones border the path. Two dogs are following an old woman in gardening clothes as she strolls along. She is in the middle distance, small beneath the trees, beneath the snowy peaks. It is winter. All the elms are bare. The scene is both stark and comforting. This path leads toward one edge of the camp, but the wire is out of sight, or out of focus. The tiny woman very much seems at ease. She and her tiny dogs seemed swallowed by the landscape, or floating in it.
2219: 7.943624: The door of the mess hall flew open and a short, beefy man came tearing out. He jumped off the porch, running as his feet hit the ground. He didn't get far. Papa came through the doorway right behind him, in a flying leap, bellowing like a warrior, "Yaaaaaah!"
1568: 7.940417: So here's another day I spend away from you. Another night I'm on another broken avenue. My bag is ripped and worn, then again, now so am I. Take what you want to take, what you want to take, what you... I miss the stupid things, we go to sleep and then you wake me up and kick me out of bed at 3 AM. Pick up the phone and hear you saying things to me, do what you want to do, what you want to do, what you. Take me with you, I start to miss you. Take me home, I don't want to be alone tonight. And I do want to show you I will run to you, to you 'til I can't stand on my own anymore.
130: 7.9320745: It's a queer thing, growing up. The years pile up, Hap, but at the same time I'm still ever age I ever was. When we stood before those sea-giants, I felt five years old, awed and scared. When I see a pretty lady, I'm eighteen again! And when my bones remind me, I feel all of my sixty years. All those ages are still inside me, all at once. The years stack up like sediment, and the layers remain.
169: 7.931997: Well, then, here we are. A little challenge for you all as you embark on your separate doctoral journeys, whatever they may be, Mr. Hawking. Something to separate the men from the boys, the wheat from the chaff, the mesons from the pi mesons, the quarks from the quacks. Ten questions, each more impregnable than the last. Good luck. You'll need it.
831: 7.927504: Far away far away never getting close, guess it's best cause if you came back all you'd ever see was ghosts. Maybe I should have gone with you, warning signs were always there, if I stayed here any longer I might lose my chance forever. Yeah I'm sinking in the quicksand of a place I once called home, that's growing everyday but I've never felt more alone. Well you went out on your own, I wonder if you feel the same. Loneliness is quite the company I hope that you're okay.
1636: 7.927403: Well, thank you, Big Baby. Why don't you come meet our new friends? Poor baby. We were thrown out together, me and him. Abandoned by the same owner. But we don't need owners at Sunnyside. We own ourselves. We're masters of our own fate. We control our own destiny.
1619: 7.9260063: I gotta say what's on my mind. Somethin' about us doesn't seem right these days. Life keeps getting in the way. Whenever we try, somehow, the plan is always rearranged. It's so hard to say, but I gotta do what's best for me. You'll be okay. I've got to move on and be who I am. I just don't belong here, I hope you understand. We might find a place in this world someday. But at least for now, I gotta go my own way.
1869: 7.924834: There was a swirling mass of water that lived in a quiet pond. It asked permission from its master, to visit the lands beyond. And its master allowed it to fly. So the wind swept the whirlpool across the sky. The whirlpool's mother wore a jacket she'd sewn out of dental floss. It was stolen by a monkey, that sold it to an albatross. And it had the idea to fly. So the wind swept the whirlpool across the sky.
2151: 7.921671: What happens to a dream deferred? Does it dry up like a raisin in the sun? Or fester like a sore- and then run? Does it stink like rotten meat? Or crust over- like a syrupy sweet? Maybe it just sags like a heavy load. Or does it... explode?
1299: 7.921608: Hey, you're making yourselves look like fools. Let's be honest, boys. You're never gonna be real scarers. Because real scarers look like us. But hey, if you really want to work for a scare company, they're always... hiring in the mailroom.
1105: 7.918726: One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin. He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked.
2173: 7.913192: I told you that if you hadn't lost your head I'd have made you go read to her. I wanted you to see something about her - I wanted you to see what real courage is, instead of getting the idea that courage is a man with a gun in his hand. It's when you know you're licked before you begin but you begin anyway and you see it through no matter what. You rarely win, but sometimes you do. Mrs. Dubose won, all ninety-eight pounds of her. According to her views, she died beholden to nothing and nobody. She was the bravest person I ever knew.
1892: 7.9117374: After the nightmares, weak is our mind. It could be the devil hiding inside everyone. Throughout these visions, it's reality, but now it makes me wonder should I carry on my way. So close to the edge, black is the night. From here to madness there's only a short step to die. Lost in the trouble, eternally I am crawling in the fire and reaching eternity. Far away beyond the sky. I come alive again screaming in the wild, resound everywhere.
2195: 7.908299: I think he knows I'm alive, having come down the tree steps of the back porch and given me a good once over. All afternoon he's been moving back and forth, gathering odd bits of walnut shells and twigs, while all about him the great fields tumble to the blades of the thresher. He's lucky to be where he is, wild with all that happens. He's lucky he's not one of the shadows living in the blond heart of the wheat. The autumn when trees bolt, dark with the fires of starlight, he'll curl among their roots, wanting nothing but the slow burn of matter on which he fastens like a small, brown flame.
903: 7.904731: It's the ship that made the Kessel run in less than twelve parsecs. I've outrun Imperial starships. Not the local bulk cruisers, mind you. I'm talking about the big Corellian ships, now. She's fast enough for you, old man.
2192: 7.902199: I'm guessin' that if we can make some wishes out of airplanes, then maybe, oh maybe, I'll go back to the days before the politics that we call the rap game, and back when ain't nobody listened to my mixtape. So can I get a wish to end the politics, and get back to the music that started this...? So here I stand, and then again I say - I'm hoping we can make some wishes out of airplanes.
1518: 7.901067: Look at this! That Gabriella girl just dumped her lunch on me, on purpose! It's all part of their plan to ruin our musical. And Troy and his basketball robots are obviously behind it. Why do you think he auditioned? After all the hard work you've put into the show, it just doesn't seem right!
1304: 7.8974476: That stuff would've informed you that this particular child is afraid of snakes, so a roar wouldn't make him scream, it would make him cry. Alerting his parents... exposing the monster world, destroying life as we know it, and of course, we can't have that. So, I'm afraid I cannot recommend that you continue in the Scaring Program. Good day.
2256: 7.8885593: I used to rule the world: seas would rise when I gave the word. Now in the morning, I sleep alone - sweep the streets I used to own. I used to roll the dice - feel the fear in my enemy's eyes. Listen as the crowd would sing, "Now the old King is dead, long live the King." One minute I held the key; next the walls were closed on me - and I discovered that my castles stand upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand.
2335: 7.8878126: In the early and middle stages of any quest, there is often a Valley of Disappointment. You expect to make progress in a linear fashion and it's frustrating how ineffective changes can seem during first days, weeks, and even months. It doesn't feel like you are going anywhere. It's a hallmark of any compounding process: the most powerful outcomes are delayed.
1991: 7.881195: What matter? We will build another windmill. We will build six windmills if we feel like it. You do not appreciate, comrade, the mighty thing that we have done. The enemy was in occupation of this very ground that we stand upon. And now - thanks to the leadership of Comrade Napoleon - we have won every inch of it back again!
2034: 7.8799906: Hey, you guys, look, I know I'm just the dude that carries the bags. But it seems to me we all play an important part in this group. I mean, we're just like a big, delicious banana split. Fred, you're the big banana. Daphne, you're the pastrami and bubble gum flavored ice cream, and Velma, you're the sweet and sour mustard sauce that goes on top.
1578: 7.879461: Let's get something straight, Carlton. I've been out here for two months. I'm getting yelled at home, shouted at school, grounded, and threatened with expulsion on an almost daily basis. And now, when I finally find something I'm down with it, you can't take it. Well, I'm not about to sell myself short just so you can look good. So just grow up.
1539: 7.8790236: Listen, baby. Ain't no mountain high, ain't no valley low, ain't no river wide enough, baby. If you need me, call me. No matter where you are, no matter how far, don't worry, baby. Just call my name, I'll be there in a hurry, you don't have to worry. 'Cause baby, there ain't no mountain high enough, ain't no valley low enough, ain't no river wide enough, to keep me from getting to you, babe.
1116: 7.878084: It is a law of nature we overlook, that intellectual versatility is the compensation for change, danger, and trouble. An animal perfectly in harmony with its environment is a perfect mechanism. Nature never appeals to intelligence until habit and instinct are useless. There is no intelligence where there is no change and no need of change. Only those animals partake of intelligence that have a huge variety of needs and dangers.
1265: 7.8776126: Sid Phillips reporting. Launch of shuttle has been delayed due to adverse weather conditions at the Launch Site. Tomorrow's forecast: sunny, ha, ha, ha! Sweet dreams!
2129: 7.86621: Many animals, such as eagles, hawks, owls, foxes, bobcats, and coyotes, like to eat rabbits and hares. This means they must always be alert for danger. If they detect danger, one thing they can do is run away. And they can run fast! Some kinds of hares can run 35 mph or more.
113: 7.861295: Nothing in this world can take the place of good old persistence. Talent won't. Nothing's more common than unsuccessful men with talent. Genius won't. Unrecognized genius is practically a cliche. Education won't. Why the world is full of educated fools? Persistence and determination alone are all powerful.
1660: 7.8563566: The fleeting winds of time, flying through each day. All the things I should've done, but time just slipped away. Remember seize the day. Life goes by in the blink of an eye, with so much left to say. These were the best of times, I'll miss these days. Your spirit lit my life each day. Thank you for the inspiration. Thank you for the smiles. All the unconditional love. That carried me for miles. It carried me for miles, but most of all, thank you for my life.
126: 7.855781: This neighborhood is a lifeboat in a storm we can't stop. Only so many people can be in our boat, no matter how many swimmers you see bobbing about in the ocean. If you try to pull in too many, you sink. You save nobody, including those who were in the boat. Our priority has to be those who are in the boat, because we can't save all of those who need to be in the boat. Our only exception has been when those on the outside can make our lifeboat stronger and more self-sustaining.
1399: 7.8545065: There's something very strange going on with Dr. Doofenshmirtz. He's been very quiet lately, a little too quiet! I want you to find out what's not going on and, uh... put a... stop... to it. I suppose.
1607: 7.8505635: Congratulations on not being dead, curly. You surprised me. But I'm still not taking that thing back. You wanna get to Te Fiti, you have to go through a whole ocean of bad. Not to mention Te Ka. Lava monster? Ever defeat a lava monster?
1469: 7.848727: Back when the arcade first opened, Turbo Time was by far the most popular game, and Turbo, he loved the attention. So when Road Blasters got plugged in and stole Turbo's thunder, boy was he jealous. So jealous, that he abandoned his game and tried to take over the new one. Turbo ended up putting both games and himself out of order, for good.
2209: 7.8439255: A wizard of Oz prototype fakes functionality that you want to test with users, saving you the time and money of actually creating it. Wizard of Oz prototypes often refer to prototypes of digital systems, in which the user thinks the response is computer-driven, when in fact it's human-controlled.
1529: 7.8412747: Here, one of everything! No cheese, no crust, no pickles to the left, four squirts of ketchup, wheat buns, non-dairy lettuce, and farm-raised tomatoes, carnival style! And if there is anything else I can do, please hesitate to ask!
261: 7.8405776: The man that I named the Giver passed along to the boy knowledge, history, memories, color, pain, laughter, love, and truth. Every time you place a book in the hands of a child, you do the same thing. It is very risky. But each time a child opens a book, he pushes open the gate that separates him from Elsewhere. It gives him choices. It gives him freedom. Those are magnificent, wonderfully unsafe things.
1508: 7.837835: I'm surprised that you called. 'Cause the way you walked away, I thought I wasn't gon' see you no more. Since you didn't wanna give me your math, I thought that you were iggin' me, and wasn't diggin' me. But anyway, what you doing tonight? I'll probably be with my peeps. If it's cool with you, maybe we'll swing by and you can just chill with us, or you can just chill with me. As long as you're comfortable and you feel secure when you're with me.
2198: 7.837638: I hustle upstream. I grasp. I grind. I control and panic. Poke balloons in my chest, always popping there, always my thoughts thump, thump. I snooze - wake and go boom. All day, like this I short my breath. I scroll and scroll. I see what you wrote - I like. I heart. My thumb, so...
1608: 7.833981: Is that why your hook's not working? You don't wanna talk? Don't talk. You wanna throw me off the boat? Throw me off. You wanna tell me I don't know what I'm doing? I know I don't. I have no idea why the ocean chose me. You're right. But, my island is dying. So I am here. It's just me and you. And I want to help. But I can't if you don't let me.
2063: 7.83353: An earthquake is a perceptible shaking of the surface of the Earth which can be violent enough to destroy major buildings and kill thousands of people. The severity of the shaking can be barely felt, or violent enough to toss people around. People often confuse earthquakes for Teminite gigs, but that's okay. Let the earth quake!
52: 7.8278446: It was a merry journey with Tom Bombadil trotting gaily beside them, or before them, on Fatty Lumpkin, who could move much faster than his girth promised. Tom sang most of the time, but it was chiefly nonsense, or else perhaps a strange language unknown to the hobbits, an ancient language whose words were mainly those of wonder and delight.
1467: 7.8239: No, not cool! Unhygienic, and lonely, and boring... and that crummy medal was going to change all that. I go home with that baby around my neck and I'll get a penthouse, pies, ice sculptures, fireworks! Ah, it's grown up stuff, you wouldn't understand.
1668: 7.8232336: Oh, please let me hear your voice, the angel of salvation. Wonder if she talks to me and holds my body certainly. So, please let me hear your voice, the angel of salvation. Wonder if she takes on me, wonder if she gives her love to me. Oh, please let me hear your voice, the angel of salvation. Wonder if she talks to me and holds my body certainly. So, please let me hear your voice, the angel of salvation. Wonder if she takes on me. Wonder if she gives her love to me.
1398: 7.8145742: Hey Ferb, do you think we can get any more power? I mean, I know it's just a battery, but I was thinking... let's open it up and see what this puppy can... Uh, Ferb, we're actually slowing down now. Ferb...? Hello?
911: 7.814484: He kept going, his eyes glued to Minho just a few steps ahead of him. He didn't feel anything for Jack. He didn't care if he was permanently deaf. He didn't care about the others anymore. The chaos around him seemed to siphon his humanity, turn him into an animal. All he wanted was to survive, make it to the building, get inside. Live. Gain another day.
108: 7.8127556: For instance, on the planet Earth, man had always assumed that he was more intelligent than dolphins because he had achieved so much - the wheel, New York, wars and so on - whilst all the dolphins had ever done was muck about in the water having a good time. But conversely, the dolphins had always believed that they were far more intelligent than man - for precisely the same reasons.
2207: 7.8126955: Rather than prototype a complete mockup of a solution, it's more productive to single out and test a specific variable. Identifying a variable not only saves time and money, it gives you the opportunity to test multiple prototypes, each varying in one property. This encourages the user to make nuanced comparisons between prototypes and choose one option over another.
1309: 7.8084188: You get one chimerito and they give you like a dozen little packets of Diablo sauce. You can't possibly use all this sauce. Somewhere, there's a landfill loaded with unopened hot sauce. And someday, I'm gonna find it.
1430: 7.795873: I'd like my cartoon character to have the power to be everywhere at once. I'd be called Multi-Man! And Ferb would have a utility belt, and use lots of crazy gadgets! He'd be called... um, Ferb Guy!
2157: 7.794657: Sometimes we eat together in the cafeteria. Morrie, to my delight, is even more of a slob than I am. He talks instead of chewing, laughs with his mouth open, delivers a passionate thought through a mouthful of egg salad, the little yellow pieces are spewing from his teeth. It cracks me up. The whole time I know him, I have two overwhelming desires: to hug him and to give him a napkin.
1384: 7.7905993: Listen, Morty, I hate to break it to you, but what people call love is just a chemical reaction that compels animals to breed. It hits hard, Morty, then it slowly fades, leaving you stranded in a failing marriage. I did it. Your parents are gonna do it. Break the cycle, Morty. Rise above. Focus on science.
1739: 7.7892957: For decades the recommended style was to break after binary operators. But this can hurt readability in two ways: the operators tend to get scattered across different columns on the screen, and each operator is moved away from its operand and onto the previous line. To solve this readability problem, mathematicians and their publishers follow the opposite convention.
1389: 7.7881966: I'm gonna make a change for once in my life. Gonna feel real good, gonna make a difference, gonna make it right. As I turn up the collar on my favorite winter coat, this wind is blowing my mind. I see the kids in the street, with not enough to eat. Who am I to be blind, pretending not to see their needs. A summer's disregard, a broken bottle top, and a one man's soul. They follow each other on the wind, ya know. 'Cause they got nowhere to go, that's why I want you to know.
2359: 7.786592: Abuela. I can finally see. You lost your home. Lost everything. You suffered so much, all alone, so it would never happen again. We were saved because of you. We were given a miracle, because of you. We are a family because of you. And nothing could ever be broken that we can't fix... together. I asked my Pedro for help. Mirabel. He sent me you.
1838: 7.7809978: An exquisite pleasure had invaded my senses, but individual, detached, with no suggestion of its origin. And at once the vicissitudes of life had become indifferent to me, its disasters innocuous, its brevity illusory, this new sensation having had on me the effect which love has of filling me with a precious essence; or rather this essence was not in me, it was myself. I had ceased now to feel mediocre, contingent, mortal.
1110: 7.768887: That Sunday, cloud spilled down from the sky and swamped the streets with a hot mist that made the thermometers on the walls perspire. Halfway through the afternoon, the temperature was already grazing the nineties as I set off towards Calle Canuda for my appointment with Barcelo, carrying the book under my arm and with beads of sweat on my forehead.
2320: 7.7667184: We first record to-be-remembered information as a fleeting sensory memory. From there, we process information into short-term memory, where we encode it through rehearsal. Finally, information moves into long-term memory for later retrieval.
944: 7.762738: If men learn this, it will implant forgetfulness in their souls; they will cease to exercise memory because they rely on that which is written, calling things to remembrance no longer from within themselves, but by means of external marks. What you have discovered is a recipe not for memory, but for reminder. And it is no true wisdom that you offer your disciples, but only its semblance, for by telling them of many things without teaching them you will make them seem to know much, while for the most part they know nothing, and as men filled, not with wisdom, but with the conceit of wisdom, they will be a burden to their fellows.
1839: 7.762332: Perhaps you've seen it, maybe in a dream. A murky, forgotten land. A place where souls may mend your ailing mind. You will lose everything, once branded. The symbol of the curse. An augur of darkness. Your past, your future, your very light. None will have meaning and you won't even care. By then you'll be something other than human. A thing that feeds on souls. A hollow.
1097: 7.760951: Trying to get data out of a PSD file is like trying to find something in the attic of your eccentric old uncle who died in a freak freshwater shark attack on his 58th birthday. That last detail may not be important for the purposes of the simile, but at this point I am spending a lot of time imagining amusing fates for the people responsible for this Rube Goldberg of a file format.
897: 7.7600236: Gary can't you see I was blind? I'll do anything to change your mind. More than a pet you're my best friend. Too cool to forget come back 'cause we are family and forgive me for making you wanna roam. And now my heart is beating like the saddest metronome. Somewhere I hope you're reading my latest three word poem: Gary come home.
16: 7.7563505: This next test may involve trace amounts of time travel. So, word of advice: If you meet yourself on the testing track, don't make eye contact. Lab boys tell me that'll wipe out time. Entirely. Forward and backward! So do both of yourselves a favor and just let that handsome devil go about his business.
60: 7.7552757: Oh, you have to trust me, Regina. I know best. Love is weakness, Regina. It feels real now. At the start, it always does. But, it's an illusion. It fades. And then, you're left with nothing. But power, true power, endures. And then, you don't have to rely on anyone to get what you want. I've saved you, my love.
2178: 7.751593: There was a man Dill had heard of who had a boat that he rowed across to a foggy island where all these babies were; you could order one - "That's a lie. Aunty said God drops 'em down the chimney. At least that's what I think she said." For once, Aunty's diction had not been too clear.
2272: 7.7454705: Political danger. The great houses look to us for leadership and this threatens the Emperor. By taking Arrakis from the Harkonnens and making it ours he sets the stage for a war which would weaken both houses. But if we hold firm and tap the true power of Arrakis we could be stronger than ever.
1506: 7.7429748: Want to but I can't help it, I love the way it feels. It's got me stuck between my fantasy and what is real. I need it when I want it, I want it when I don't. Tell myself I'll stop everyday, knowin' that I won't. I got a problem and I don't know what to do about it, even if I did I don't know if I would quit. But, I doubt it. I'm taken by the thought of it. And I know this much is true. Baby, you have become my addiction. I'm so strung out on you, I can barely move. But, I like it. And it's all because of you.
20: 7.7357535: This subspecies of grub-dog has a thick coat of soft white fur that obscures its abdominal markings. The fur also warms its vital organs, making this species well adapted to colder climates. However, its hair follicles are surprisingly frail, which can result in immediate hair loss if the creature is surprised.
1446: 7.7296143: "Let's agree to disagree" shouldn't end a discussion. It should start a new conversation, with a focus on understanding and learning rather than arguing and persuading. That's what we'd do in scientist mode: take the long view and ask how we could have handled the debate more effectively.
1553: 7.7286487: The physical appearance of the please makes no difference. It is still no, so go to sleep. Cookie robots! I said cookie robots! Ah, why, why are you so, old? What are you talking about? These are kittens! Any relation to persons living or dead is completely coincidental.
1490: 7.7275634: Look at me, I will never pass for a perfect bride or a perfect daughter. Can it be, I'm not meant to play this part? Now I see that if I were truly to be myself, I would break my family's heart. Who is that girl I see staring straight back at me? Why is my reflection someone I don't know? Somehow I cannot hide who I am, though I've tried. When will my reflection show who I am inside?
1796: 7.7230043: For god's sake, you're BOXES with LEGS! It's literally your only purpose! Walking onto buttons! How can you not do the one thing you were designed for?
2336: 7.7226214: You think, "I've been running every day for a month, so why can't I see any change in my body?" Once this kind of thinking takes over, it's easy to let good habits fall by the wayside. But in order to make a meaningful difference, habits need to persist long enough to break through this plateau.
1565: 7.7225432: Thank you, Walt. If anyone ever got hold of anchovy DNA, they could chop out the oil-making gene, stick it in a bunch of 3rd world kids, and bam! Cheap effective robot oil. Enough to put dear old mom out of business.
1820: 7.72217: They told me if I ever turned this flashlight on, I would DIE. They told me that about EVERYTHING. I don't know why they even bothered to give me this stuff if they didn't want me using it. It's pointless.
2374: 7.719863: Type 1a supernovae are thought to be potentially the most dangerous if they occur close enough to the Earth. Because these supernovae arise from dim, common white dwarf stars in binary systems, it is likely that a supernova that can affect the Earth will occur unpredictably and in a star system that is not well studied.
2087: 7.7168746: So the question remains: why do we still use QWERTY? There is no reason, aside from the fact that it came first. It was already the standard when computer keyboards came into prominence, and now that it's so widespread, it would be an extremely difficult task to alter that standard.
2175: 7.714056: Somehow everything was different, like a new person had emerged from me; I could see myself in a perspective that I've never seen before: no ambitions, no worries. For the first time I felt like I knew where I belonged and nothing could stop me from being there. Nothing and yet everything felt real. The world was underneath me, around me, above me; I could see everything and everything could see me. I found... Peace.
18: 7.713439: Your biggest concern while in this realm will likely be the Nyctofly. This airborne insect lives in heavily wooded areas and can locate you from far away. When you hear its wings fluttering, you know that it's time to fight. It's much harder to fight in open areas, so it's advised to stay in a tight space.
1664: 7.711128: Even if we fell down on the ground, we strongly believe light lights up our feet. Keep going to win, never lose our faith. We are the force of courage. Even if we fell down on the ground, we only believe we can see the rising sun. Keep going to win, never lose our faith until the end. Pray to the edge of the sky. We go to where no one could ever see. Pray to the edge of the sky. Surely we carry out promise with you. Until the end we will keep fighting for you until the end I will stand there for you. And we will stand on the promised land, we'll raise our swords, and raise our flag.
1666: 7.6991606: As sworn allies, we fight, never been apart. Winning is the only way for us to live. Those of who lost their lives live in our minds. Everything I have seen still not the past. Grieving rain of tears. Just falling on me. Piercing my heart; it flows to the sea. Grieving rain of blood. Just wearing for me. Dyeing my soul, and it flows to the sea.
1270: 7.694002: The booming jerked me out my sleep, woke the dishes and set them chattering, and sent Clara dashing through the dark to the children. "Must be Lord comin!" cried one of the servants. I realized I'd been dreaming of Mexico. Strange.
1417: 7.691283: Perry the Platypus, how unexpected! And by "unexpected", I mean... unexpected. What are you doing here? This is my week off.
1290: 7.6866174: The atomic number or proton number (symbol Z) of a chemical element is the number of protons found in the nucleus of every atom of that element. The atomic number uniquely identifies a chemical element.
1861: 7.684532: "Ford!" he said, "there's an infinite number of monkeys outside who want to talk to us about this script for Hamlet they've worked out."
1431: 7.6795883: Brothers. Does every sister have to deal with this? No. Do I have to deal with this? Of course. You'd think I'd have better things to do and more important things to worry about. Every single day it's one thing after another. But do Mom and Dad see it? No. Do they get in trouble? No. And another thing...
1803: 7.6750946: Remember before when I was talking about smelly garbage standing around being useless? That was a metaphor. I was actually talking about you. And I'm sorry. You didn't react at the time, so I was worried it sailed right over your head. Which would have made this apology seem insane. That's why I had to call you garbage a second time just now.
1092: 7.674731: Rather than offer you the illusion of free choice, I will take the liberty of choosing for you... if and when your time comes round again. I do apologize for what must seem to you an arbitrary imposition, Dr. Freeman. I trust it will all make sense to you in the course of... well... I'm really not at liberty to say. In the meantime... this is where I get off.
1863: 7.667983: "I like the cover," he said. "Don't panic. It's the first helpful or intelligible thing anybody's said to me all day."
1655: 7.6615496: You're smart enough for me to trust. Go live your life now. Just keep these steps in your life and you'll know how. If you're not sure, ask yourself, "Have I done to them as I would have them do to me?" Look in the mirror, what's that you see? The shattered fortress. Fly now be free.
1708: 7.661202: We've heard all about the Great Deliverer. The BT Buster. The terrorist... er... stopper. I'm still working on that last one.
1794: 7.660532: Alright, this next test may involve trace amounts of time travel. So, word of advice: if you meet yourself on the testing track, don't make eye contact. Lab boys tell me that'll wipe out time. Entirely. Forward and backward. So do both of yourselves a favor and just let that handsome devil go about his business.
1659: 7.655257: Lying on the pillows at the old 812 watching Harold and Maude. The record shops, the stickball fields - my home away from home. And when we weren't together - the hours on the phone. I'll always remember, those were the best of times. I'll cherish them forever. The best of times.
1602: 7.6520386: Come on, there's something I need to show you. I've wanted to bring you here from the moment you opened your eyes. This is a sacred place. The place of chiefs. There will come a time when you will stand on this peak and place a stone on this mountain. Like I did. Like my father did. And his father and every chief there has ever been. And on that day, when you place your stone, you will raise this whole island higher. You are the future of our people, Moana. They are not out there. They are right here. It's time to be who they need you to be.
1246: 7.6514616: How do I say goodbye to what we had? The good times that made us laugh outweigh the bad. I thought we'd get to see forever, but forever's gone away. It's so hard to say goodbye to yesterday. I don't know where this road is going to lead. All I know is where we've been and what we've been through. If we get to see tomorrow I hope it's worth all the wait. It's so hard to say goodbye to yesterday.
1516: 7.644043: West High Knights have knocked us out of the playoffs three years running, and now we are one game away from taking that championship right back from 'em! It's time to make our stand. The team is you. You are the team. And this team does not exist unless each and every one of you is fully focused on our goal. Am I clear?
1351: 7.6424236: Look at everybody's favorite scarer now! You stupid, pathetic waste! You've been number one for too long, Sullivan! Now your time is up! And don't worry! I'll take good care of the kid!
1738: 7.642115: The preferred way of wrapping long lines is by using Python's implied line continuation inside parentheses, brackets and braces. Long lines can be broken over multiple lines by wrapping expressions in parentheses. These should be used in preference to using a backslash for line continuation.
1912: 7.6416616: The stupidest questions of all were asked by Mollie, the white mare. The very first question she asked Snowball was: "Will there still be sugar after the Rebellion?"
1646: 7.6411934: Research in psychology has revealed that our decisions are disrupted by an array of biases and irrationalities: We're overconfident. We seek out information that supports us and downplay information that doesn't. We get distracted by short-term emotions.
1731: 7.639727: What if you knew this is not the way things are supposed to be? I'm not like that. I'm not into the whole "destiny, there's-only-one-right-way" thing. I'm not either, but what's worse? Thinking you're being paranoid or knowing you should be?
1571: 7.6393223: No matter how much we fought each other, though, if we faced an outsider, the unbreakable bonds of brotherhood tightened between us. As the saying goes, "Fighting within these walls disappears at an outside threat."
1316: 7.634111: "Shego, just my way of saying thanks for a super year, and Merry Christmas. Yours in evil, Dr. Drakken." Aw, that is so nice! Guess I should have taken his call.
1468: 7.6336107: Do you have any idea what you put me through? I ran higgeldy-piggeldy all over creation looking for you! I almost drowned in chocolate milk mix! And then... I met the most dynamite gal.
105: 7.6334124: Ever since the dawn of civilization, people have not been content to see events as unconnected and inexplicable. They have craved an understanding of the underlying order in the world. Today we still yearn to know why we are here and where we came from. Humanity's deepest desire for knowledge is justification enough for our continuing quest. And our goal is nothing less than a complete description of the universe we live in.
1368: 7.6304145: Now, a clock needs to be clean, well-lubricated and wound tight. The best clocks have jewel movements, cogs that fit, that cooperate by design. I'm being metaphorical, Bob... You know what I mean by cooperative cogs?
2145: 7.62957: Joyce Hogi laughed when she read the reports claiming that the city would be tens of millions of dollars ahead, and her neighborhood would experience big economic gains. "You don't have to be an economist to figure out that this is nonsense," she thought.
1924: 7.6272273: After much thought Snowball declared that the Seven Commandments could in effect be reduced to a single maxim, namely: "Four legs good, two legs bad".
1626: 7.6250076: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I'll be right there. And we're gonna do this commercial in one take. Do you hear me? Because I am in the middle of something really important. Oh... You, my little cowboy friend, are gonna make me big buck-buck-bucks!
1609: 7.6248374: I wasn't born a demigod. I had human parents. They... They took one look and decided they did not want me. They threw me into the sea, like I was nothing. Somehow I was found by the gods. They gave me the hook. They made me, Maui. And back to the humans I went. I gave them islands, fire, coconuts. Anything they could ever want.
1113: 7.618161: Listen to the people who love you. Believe that they are worth living for even when you don't believe it. Seek out the memories depression takes away and project them into the future. Be brave; be strong; take your pills. Exercise because it's good for you even if every step weighs a thousand pounds. Eat when food itself disgusts you. Reason with yourself when you have lost your reason.
1074: 7.6181307: Security, like backing up, is one of those topics that we all should probably take more seriously than we do. Whenever reports are released highlighting popular password selections, it's clear that not everyone is on the same page, or even reading from the same book. But whether you have strong passwords or not, your accounts can still be compromised, and then you've got to ask yourself what you're going to do about it.
1736: 7.6139765: Continuation lines should align wrapped elements either vertically using Python's implicit line joining inside parentheses, brackets and braces, or using a hanging indent. When using a hanging indent the following should be considered; there should be no arguments on the first line and further indentation should be used to clearly distinguish itself as a continuation line.
82: 7.61185: On a clear day you can see for twenty-five miles in all directions because you are in the largest observation wheel ever built. You are sealed into one of the thirty-two capsules with the strangers who were next to you in the queue, and when they close the doors, the sound of the city is cut off. You begin to rise. The capsules are made of glass and steel and are hung from the rim of the wheel. As the wheel turns, the capsules use the force of gravity to stay upright. It takes thirty minutes to go a full circle.
1501: 7.610681: I've heard a great deal about you, Fa Mulan. You stole your father's armor, ran away from home, impersonated a soldier, deceived your commanding officer, dishonored the Chinese Army, destroyed my palace, and... you have saved us all.
1356: 7.610259: No matter how many times you save the world, it always manages to get back in jeopardy again. Sometimes I just want it to STAY SAVED, you know? For a little bit. I feel like the maid. I just cleaned up this mess. Can we keep it clean for ten minutes?!
124: 7.603441: It'd be like looking for a needle in a burning haystack. Oh, I've done that, Mark said airily. It's a game we used to play, after we got rid of all our livestock and didn't need our hay no more. You throw a match into the haystack, give the fire a three-second head start, and begin looking. You can find the needle every time if you work quick.
2088: 7.6015744: There are a surprising amount of alternate layouts, and my only problem with Colemak was an over-reliance on the middle two columns. There are a number of factors that keyboard layouts can optimize for, but I was looking for maximum home row usage with minimal middle column usage.
2060: 7.5919557: "When you forge a weapon, you need three things: the right metal, temperatures over fourteen hundred degrees... and someone who wants to kill." Here in Jungle Village, we got all three.
141: 7.5911975: A week ago you said to me, "Do you believe I'll never be too far." If you're lost, just look for me, you'll find me in the region of the summer stars. The fact that we can sit right here and say goodbye means we've already won. A necessity for apologies between you and me, baby, there is none.
1913: 7.587143: In Sugarcandy Mountain it was Sunday seven days a week, clover was in season all the year round, and lump sugar and linseed cake grew on the hedges. The animals hated Moses because he told tales and did no work, but some of them believed in Sugarcandy Mountain, and the pigs had to argue very hard to persuade them that there was no such place.
1680: 7.587116: Stardust is falling down to the ground. We found small light in the wind. We raise our hands for the starlight. We pray with reverence. Stardust is falling down to the ground. We found small light in the wind. We raise our hands for the starlight. We found small light in the wind. We raise our hands for the starlight.
1583: 7.587069: Rise and shine, Mr. Freeman. Rise and shine. Not that I wish to imply you have been sleeping on the job. No one is more deserving of a rest. And all the effort in the world would have gone to waste until... Well, let's just say your hour has come again. The right man in the wrong place can make all the difference in the world. So, wake up, Mr. Freeman. Wake up and smell the ashes.
1543: 7.5851254: Pretty brown eyes, you know I see you, girl. It's a disguise the way you treat me. You keep holding on to your thoughts of rejection. If you're with me, you're secured. You keep telling me that your time is always taken. But I keep seeing you out alone. Listen to love, your heart is pounding with desire, waiting to be unleashed. Quit breakin' my heart.
1875: 7.5797963: It won't be long now, love, like mist I slowly fill the room. I place a black candle on your chest, the path of night is manifest. I never wanted us to end up in this catatonic phase. It wasn't me who ran away, you made me stray. Open your blue eyes, tell me that you love me. Make me believe it, oh I know you lie. Broke the vow I thought you made, my angel, why. Settling the score, we pass the twilight.
1380: 7.5788693: No, no, I'm a new superhero! I'm Syndrome! All right, stand back! Someone needs to teach this hunk of metal a few manners.
2197: 7.5765057: What do you know of your scientific name? - amoeba, protozoa, diatom, algae - you live with it regardless of your despair. Our studies, also, are of fear. Our hands grow cold in beholding what may become of us. We make connections if we can, while eyes draw us to them, large in silence.
1613: 7.5758843: I've been staring at the edge of the water long as I can remember, never really knowing why. I wish I could be the perfect daughter, but I come back to the water, no matter how hard I try. Every turn I take, every trail I track, every path I make, every road leads back, to the place I know where I cannot go, where I long to be. See the line where the sky meets the sea? It calls me. And no one knows, how far it goes. If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me, one day I'll know. If I go there's just no telling how far I'll go.
83: 7.5757694: While Dorothy was looking earnestly into the queer, painted face of the Scarecrow, she was surprised to see one of the eyes slowly wink at her. She thought she must have been mistaken, at first, for none of the scarecrows in Kansas ever wink; but presently the figure nodded its head to her in a friendly way. Then she climbed down from the fence and walked up to it, while Toto ran around the pole and barked.
190: 7.5690255: Is "defeat" proof that you are weak? Isn't "defeat" more like a trial to overcome? Of whether you can stand up and walk again after falling to your knees? If you remain on your knees like that, then it would be a sign of weakness.
2215: 7.5642095: It told her, "don't you worry, just follow everywhere I go: top of all the mountains or valley low. I'll give you everything you've been dreaming of, just let me in. Everything you want in gold, I'll be the magic story you've been told, and you'll be safe under my control; just let me in."
2048: 7.5621347: Who made man's power? Who made the deaf, the mute, the seeing and the blind? Was it not I? Now go! Oh, Moses. I shall be with you when you go to the king of Egypt, but Pharaoh will not listen. So I will stretch out my hand and smite Egypt with all my wonders. Take the staff in your hand Moses. With it, you shall do my wonders. I shall be with you, Moses.
230: 7.558989: What's the use? Let's say we fought, if anybody asks. Now, go. I've no quarrel with you, besides. I'll just remain here, comfortably at rest, for some untold millennia, I guess. Have a nice... whatever time it is.
2369: 7.5573497: Alive without breath; as cold as death; never thirsting, ever drinking; clad in mail, never clinking. Drowns on dry land, thinks an island is a mountain; thinks a fountain is a puff of air. So sleek, so fair! What a joy to meet! We only wish to catch a fish, so juicy-sweet!
1240: 7.5548215: Man is a strange creature. All his actions are motivated by desire, his character forged by pain. As much as he may try to suppress that pain, to repress the desire, he cannot free himself from the eternal servitude to his feelings. For as long as the storm rages within him, he cannot find peace. Not in life, not in death. And so he will do what he must, day in, day out. The pain is his vessel, desire his compass. It is all that man is capable of.
2205: 7.553458: The hard part is selecting which ideas to act on. Brainstorm selection may be straight forward for some brainstorms, but selecting design solutions may take more deliberation. Don't pick just one and don't settle on safe choices. Select a range of ideas to carry forward into prototyping, aiming to preserve the breadth of solutions generated by the group.
1673: 7.551729: Proud enough for you to call me arrogant, greedy enough to be labeled a thief. Angry enough for me to go and hurt a man, cruel enough for me to feel no grief. Never could have just a part of it, I always need more to get by. Getting right down to the heart of it, the root of all evil has been running my whole life. Dirty enough for me to lust, leaving nothing left to trust, jealous enough to still feel envious. Lazy enough to sleep all day and let my life just waste away, selfish enough to make you wait for me.
2393: 7.5482736: He said to his friend, "If the British march by land or sea from the town to-night, hang a lantern aloft in the belfry arch of the North Church tower as a signal light, - one, if by land, and two, if by sea; and I on the opposite shore will be, ready to ride and spread the alarm through every Middlesex village and farm, for the country folk to be up and to arm."
13: 7.5457673: Your brother came all this way just to get turned into a painting... It's just terrific. However... This Mario painting looks lonely... I must have a Luigi painting as well! Then my gallery will truly be complete!
2090: 7.545396: It's been a while since I tried to learn Colemak. I underestimated how difficult it actually is to unlearn your muscle memory. When you are quick with typing, you don't think about what your fingers are doing, or where any of the letters are - it's all done by feel. I can type with my eyes closed because I've practiced enough to not need any visual reference while typing.
405: 7.544531: But now, for the first time, I see you are a man like me. I thought of your hand-grenades, of your bayonet, of your rifle; now I see your wife and your face and our fellowship. Forgive me, comrade. We always see it too late. Why do they never tell us that you are poor devils like us, that your mothers are just as anxious as ours, that we have the same fear of death, and the same dying and the same agony - Forgive me, comrade; how could you be my enemy?
1865: 7.5413175: If you could save yourself, you'd save us all. Is that what you called me for, is that why you're knocking on my door? The time I've spent, working myself to death. Thought that's what you wanted. I thought you needed my help. To make it good again, to make us strong. To make you happy, to push you along. And gain some respect, to be thrown a crumb. I was on my knees, when you knocked me down!
2158: 7.5377855: "Dying," Morrie suddenly said, "is only one thing to be sad over, Mitch. Living unhappily is something else. So many of the people who come to visit me are unhappy."
1067: 7.529899: The calculus of functions of more than one variable unites the calculus of one variable, which the reader presumably knows, with the theory of vector spaces, and the adequacy of its treatment depends directly on the extent to which vector space theory really is used. The theories of differential equations and differential geometry are similarly based on a mixture of calculus and vector space theory.
1566: 7.5277457: After another eternity there was success; one of its operations created a fundamental change in space-time, a self-contained bubble protected from the chaos, yet powered by it. With a final effort the Pattern injected itself through the event horizon and into the infinitely calm spaces beyond. Here it could cease its fight and direct all its efforts to discovery.
1387: 7.5264335: Last night I, I saw you standing and I started, started pretending that I knew you, and you knew me too. And just like a Roni, you were too shy. But you weren't the only 'cause so was I. And I dreamed of you ever since. Now I built up my confidence. Girl, next, next time you come my way, I'll know just what to say. Can we talk for a minute? Girl, I want to know your name.
1623: 7.524668: Deep within it, the Abyss creeps into your mind. Eventually, it'll get your body as well. Unlike the curse from the 6th Layer, those don't manifest immediately. For every expedition, you'll stand at the precipice of death and insanity, twisting the skin off your head.
1697: 7.5202518: There was no hope for him. Buck was inexorable. Mercy was a thing reserved for gentler climes. He manoeuvred for the final rush. The circle had tightened till he could feel the breaths of the huskies on his flanks. He could see them, beyond Spitz and to either side, half crouching on the spring, their eyes fixed upon him.
237: 7.5130424: The universe has a beginning, but no end - Infinity. Stars, too, have their own beginnings, but their own power results in their destruction - Finite. It is those who possess wisdom who are the greatest fools. History has shown us this. You could say that this is the final warning from God to those who resist.
1871: 7.5116825: 'For I am not going to tell you my name, not yet at any rate.' A queer half-knowing, half-humorous look came with a green flicker into his eyes. 'For one thing it would take a long while: my name is growing all the time, and I've lived a very long, long time; so my name is like a story. Real names tell you the story of the things they belong to in my language, in the Old Entish as you might say.'
1107: 7.5112567: A long, long time ago, I can still remember how that music used to make me smile. And I knew if I had my chance that I could make those people dance, and maybe they'd be happy for a while. But February made me shiver, with every paper I'd deliver. Bad news on the doorstep, I couldn't take one more step. I can't remember if I cried when I read about his widowed bride, something touched me deep inside, the day the music died.
482: 7.5100837: Typewriter eraser brushes were necessary for clearing eraser crumbs and paper dust, and using the brush properly was an important element of typewriting skill; if erasure detritus fell into the typewriter, a small buildup could cause the typebars to jam in their narrow supporting grooves.
2093: 7.509218: I was getting ten words per minute faster every single day, up until the fifty to sixty threshold. And I still improved, but it started to slow down to about five words per minute a day. As for QWERTY, I could still switch instantly. It didn't even take a second to adjust.
2168: 7.502073: Little Chuck grinned broadly. "There ain't no need to fear a cootie, ma'am. Ain't you ever seen one? Now don't you be afraid, you just go back to your desk and teach us some more."
1444: 7.500752: Oh, when you walk by every night, talking sweet and looking fine, I get kind of hectic inside. Baby, I'm so into you. Darling, if you only knew, all the things that float through my mind. But, it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy, baby. When I close my eyes, you come and take me on, and on, and on. It's so deep in my daydreams, but it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy, baby.
2404: 7.499808: The postmodern notion that reality is only a construct - that we are what we program - suggests limitless human possibilities; but as the young spend less and less of their lives in natural surroundings, their senses narrow, physiologically and psychologically, and this reduces the richness of human experience.
1310: 7.499245: Sure. You had that skinny guy expose Adrena Lynn so she'd freak out and set up this whole 'Save Brick' thing, just to prove you dug me! Kim, you're nice and all, but you try too hard. If you just asked me out, that's cool, but this is too much. I'm sorry, but it's over.
1603: 7.492735: Because he was you. Drawn to the ocean. Down by the shore. He took a canoe, Moana. He crossed the reef and found an unforgiving sea. Waves like mountains. His best friend begged to be on that boat. He couldn't save him. He's hoping he can save you. Sometimes, who we wish we were, what we wish we can do is just not meant to be.
15: 7.4915605: With a silent order, I urged Snout forward but he veered away, charging toward Hazel instead. No, Snout! I thought. Toward the roof! He ignored me. That was the problem with a machine that obeyed your thoughts. Instead of doing what you said, it did what you wanted.
231: 7.4913588: The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of the darkness. For he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers. And you will know I am the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon you.
1514: 7.489233: We gotta do something. Okay, our callbacks are on Thursday, and the basketball game and scholastic decathlon are on Friday. Too bad all of these events weren't happening on the same day, at the same time.
163: 7.4848104: Whose woods these are I think I know. His house is in the village though; he will not see me stopping here to watch his woods fill up with snow. My little horse must think it queer to stop without a farmhouse near between the woods and frozen lake the darkest evening of the year. He gives his harness bells a shake to ask if there is some mistake. The only other sound's the sweep of easy wind and downy flake. The woods are lovely, dark and deep, but I have promises to keep, and miles to go before I sleep, and miles to go before I sleep.
2405: 7.4766164: We were like children lost in our own dream; we never knew love's a garden and hard to grow. We thought the magic would lead us upstream, but we fell. It's not our fault - it's how currents flow. Even though it's hard to know you are leaving this picture, you remain another memory of summer when we loved. Even the winter cold feels warm, shining with light from all I kept inside from you. That is how the heart can live on and on.
2050: 7.474105: Maybe we all have in us a secret pond where evil and ugly things germinate and grow strong. But this culture is fenced, and the swimming brood climbs up only to fall back. Might it not be that in the dark pools of some men the evil grows strong enough to wriggle over the fence and swim free? Would not such a man be our monster, and are we not related to him in our hidden water? It would be absurd if we did not understand both angels and devils, since we invented them.
1149: 7.4739685: I walked over to the hill where we used to go and sled. There were a lot of little kids there. I watched them flying. Doing jumps and having races. And I thought that all those little kids are going to grow up someday. And all of those little kids are going to do the things that we do. And they will all kiss someone someday. But for now, sledding is enough. I think it would be great if sledding were always enough, but it isn't.
1992: 7.4701986: They had thought that the Fifth Commandment was 'No animal shall drink alcohol', but there were two words that they had forgotten. Actually the Commandment read: 'No animal shall drink alcohol to excess.'
1615: 7.467206: We're soarin', flyin'. There's not a star in heaven that we can't reach. If we're trying, so we're breaking free. You know the world can see us in a way that's different than who we are. Creating space between us, 'til we're separate hearts. But your faith it gives me strength, strength to believe.
1522: 7.467034: But you're not just a guy, Troy. You're the team leader. What you do affects not only this team, but the entire school. And without you completely focused, we're not gonna win next week. The championship games, they don't come along all the time. They're something special.
1219: 7.4666076: I'm waking up, breathing in clean air, what a day, yeah. What a sunny, funny day. I feel so high, I can't deny, a little better than okay. Nowhere to go, I shoot for stars, I'm Galileo. Pack your bags and don't be late. The scenery flies before my eyes, don't you dream of home, 'cause it'll have to wait.
2394: 7.4660516: [In outer space,] you develop an instant global consciousness, a people orientation, an intense dissatisfaction with the state of the world, and a compulsion to do something about it.
1986: 7.464742: The next moment a choking roar of rage sounded from Napoleon's apartments. The news of what had happened sped round the farm like wildfire. Banknotes were forgeries! Frederick had got the timber for nothing!
9: 7.4646893: Today is the big day! I have devised an ingenious plan to finally steal the Krabby Patty formula! And if Bikini Bottom gets demolished in the process, oh well!
1319: 7.458455: Dating could be good, ya know, the date thing... But what if it tanks? It could totally wreck our friendship! No. No! I can't let that happen! Only one thing to do: break up with Kim! Thanks, man. You've been a big help.
2102: 7.455907: She was not a girl who could be "won" in the kinetic sense - she was proof against cleverness, she was proof against charm. Perhaps from so much youthful love, so many youthful lovers, she had come, in self defense, to nourish herself wholly from within.
1331: 7.4536605: It's 7:00 on KILL. This one goes out to Arnold, who's going to die in 2 hours, 6 minutes, and 47 seconds, from Helga who hates you.
1376: 7.45022: Shh. It isn't your fault. It wasn't fair for me to suddenly ask so much of you. But things are different now. And doubt is a luxury we can't afford anymore, sweetie. You have more power than you realize. Don't think. And don't worry. If the time comes, you'll know what to do. It's in your blood.
2171: 7.44977: She loved everything that grew in God's earth, even the weeds. With one exception. If she found a blade of nutgrass in her yard it was like the Second Battle of the Marne: she swooped down upon it with a tin tub and subjected it to blasts from beneath with a poisonous substance she said was so powerful it'd kill us all if we didn't stand out of the way.
1853: 7.449234: There exists a limit to the force even the most powerful may apply without destroying themselves. Judging this limit is the true artistry of government. Misuse of power is the fatal sin. The law cannot be a tool of vengeance, never a hostage, nor a fortification against the martyrs it has created. You cannot threaten any individual and escape the consequences.
245: 7.4477005: In most people's vocabularies, design means veneer. It's interior decorating. It's the fabric of the curtains and the sofa. But to me, nothing could be further from the meaning of design. Design is the fundamental soul of a man-made creation that ends up expressing itself in successive outer layers of the product or service.
1528: 7.447453: Practice chanters are used by beginners to learn techniques for fingering and blowing. Because pipers need to know their tunes from memory, practice chanters are also used when learning any new tune. Pipe band members practice together using practice chanters, both for practicing old tunes and for learning the tempo and notes to new music.
1661: 7.4467525: The smile of dawn, arrived early May, she carried a gift from her home. The night shed a tear to tell her of fear and of sorrow and pain she'll never outgrow. Death is the first dance, eternal. There's no more freedom, the both of you will be confined to this mind. I was told there's a miracle for each day that I try. I was told there's a new love that's born for each one that has died. I was told there'd be no one to call on when I feel alone and afraid. I was told if you dream of the next world. You'll find yourself swimming in a lake of fire.
1378: 7.445664: Just like a movie! The robot will emerge dramatically, do some damage. Throngs of screaming people! And just when all hope is lost, Syndrome will save the day! I'll be a bigger hero than you ever were!
1732: 7.445315: God, everything is so different in there. You can feel how cut off you are. It's this entirely separate world and you encompass most of it. And the sound. Isn't the sound different on the inside? It's like it's singing. I had this dream in there - I was on or near the ocean, and I just kept hearing the surf. It was so uneventful. At night. And the tide kept coming in and out.
928: 7.4441886: "This is the feeling of being lonely. Every time I savour this, it strengthens my resolve to pursue the demonic way!" Fang Yuan's gaze shone, thinking of the story of Ren Zu.
1298: 7.440102: You were right. They weren't scared of me. I did everything right. I wanted it more than anybody. And I thought... I thought if I wanted it enough, I could show everybody that... that Mike Wazowski is something special. I'm just... not.
1334: 7.437184: Can't you see? It's not about snow boots, it's not about flashy, expensive presents or getting yours before the other guy gets his! It's about showing people you really care about them! And most of all, it's about a funny football-headed kid with a good heart but no sense of reality whose entire world view is at stake!
1890: 7.43023: They bring me down, all the world is stereotypical, playing out rules, but act out another. Look now, you thought you had me by the upper-hand, but I see through the face you've covered cynical. Four, unleash the beast that lies inside of you. Three, take on the fire that burns in front of you. Two, let out the fear you feel surrounding you. One, become the soul that you were born to be.
1634: 7.424111: Well, you're safe now. We're all castoffs here. We been dumped, donated, yard-saled, secondhanded and just plain thrown out. But just you wait, you'll find being donated was the best thing that ever happened to ya.
1542: 7.4226766: Walking the streets with you and your worn-out jeans, I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be. Laughing on a park bench thinking to myself, hey, isn't this easy? And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town, I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down. You say you're fine, I know you better than that. Hey, what'cha doing with a girl like that?
2068: 7.421694: Chemists do not usually stutter. It would be very awkward if they did, seeing that they have at times to get out such words as methylethylamylophenylium.
2033: 7.4165688: At eight o'clock on Tuesday morning Arthur didn't feel very good. He woke up blearily, got up, wandered blearily round his room, opened a window, saw a bulldozer, found his slippers, and stomped off to the bathroom to wash.
2131: 7.4156404: Our knowledge has made us cynical; our cleverness, hard and unkind. We think too much and feel too little. More than machinery, we need humanity. More than cleverness, we need kindness and gentleness. Without these qualities life will be violent, and all will be lost.
2401: 7.4136434: Within the space of a few decades, the way children understand and experience nature has changed radically. The polarity of the relationship has reversed. Today, kids are aware of the global threats to the environment - but their physical contact, their intimacy with nature, is fading. That's exactly the opposite of how it was when I was a child.
587: 7.412911: Well, well! The fearsome Edward Kenway speaks, eh? Pray tell us, captain, how to quit this predicament! And tell us what genius you have for sailing a boat with no sails and no rudder!
1770: 7.412562: A great way to pick up new Haskell knowledge is to just click through the standard library reference and explore the modules and their functions. You can also view the Haskell source code for each module. Reading the source code of some modules is a really good way to learn Haskell and get a solid feel for it.
2247: 7.4104404: The young kids were mystified by this and stood open-eyed, watching. Some older folks smiled, waving as we hit a chuckhole and bounced. Papa swung left, and we clattered out onto the wide, empty boulevard that ran the length of the camp, back to where our own baggage waited and the final packing.
1761: 7.4042287: Recursion is important to Haskell because unlike imperative languages, you do computations in Haskell by declaring what something is instead of declaring how you get it. That's why there are no while loops or for loops in Haskell and instead we many times have to use recursion to declare what something is.
1500: 7.4037137: Hey, c'mon. You wanted to save your father's life. Who knew you'd end up shaming him, disgracing your ancestors and losing all your friends. Y'know, you just gotta... just gotta learn to let these things go.
1065: 7.402519: To reduce the threat of hyperinflation, the government proposed to restrict subsidies to enterprises; raise interest rates; set quarterly limits on credits, the budget deficit, and money supply growth; and impose temporary taxes and cut spending if budget targets are not met.
2260: 7.398511: The psychology department actually studies the limits of almost all psychology. And it's only when you go to graduate school that you can do some real research. In graduate school, after deciding on a specific major and an academic adviser and applying, you have to pass an interview and written evaluation of your research plans.
884: 7.397313: It's just a little old Krabby Patty smothered in jellyfish jelly. I call it a Krabby Patty with jellyfish jelly.
1544: 7.392223: Don't tell your friends that I don't mean nothing to you. Please, don't deny the truth. Tell me right now, I know your heart is in the right place. You know I won't let you down. You can't disguise all the pounding of your heart. I see your eyes and you can't hide. Start to make sense and quit playin' these love games. Tell me what you're gonna do. Quit breakin' my heart.
2118: 7.391541: My poor aunt's figure, however, would have presented astonishing difficulties to any dressmaker. Her skin was yellow as a Mongolian's from constant exposure to a pitiless wind, and to the alkaline water, which transforms the most transparent cuticle into a sort of flexible leather.
1956: 7.3913264: With some difficulty Muriel spelt it out. "It says, 'No animal shall sleep in a bed with sheets'", she announced finally.
90: 7.385918: Most winemakers, therefore, and certainly all concerned with high-volume production, choose to speed the process up by intervening with one or more of filtration, centrifugation, flotation, and the much cheaper process of fining, the addition of agents which aid agglomeration and settling of colloids in the must or new wine.
585: 7.385621: For years I've been rushing around, taking whatever I fancied, not giving a tinker's curse for those I hurt. Yet here I am... with riches and reputation, feeling no wiser than when I left home. Yet when I turn around, and look at the course I've run... there's not a man or woman that I love left standing beside me.
175: 7.384694: Are you even listening? Look at me! These kids believe in you, but this isn't about you helping them anymore. This is about you loving all of the attention, and the hero worship. If you care about these kids, I mean truly care about them, you'll turn yourself in before anyone gets hurt. That's what a real leader would have the courage to do.
167: 7.3826437: Would you really dig into yesterday's garbage to make tonight's meal? Do you dig into old mental garbage to create tomorrow's experiences? If a thought or belief does not serve you, let it go! There is no written law that says that because you once believed something, you have to continue to believe it forever.
1962: 7.380855: Napoleon ordered the almost empty bins in the store-shed to be filled nearly to the brim with sand, which was then covered up with what remained of the grain and meal. On some suitable pretext Whymper was led through the store-shed and allowed to catch a glimpse of the bins. He was deceived, and continued to report to the outside world that there was no food shortage on Animal Farm.
41: 7.3784857: People are going to tell you who you are your whole life. You just got to punch back and say, "No, this is who I am." You want people to look at you differently? Make them. You want to change this? You're going to have to go out there and change them yourself, because there are no fairy godmothers in this world.
1303: 7.377471: Well, then. I'm sure your family will be very disappointed. And Mr. Wazowski, what you lack is something that cannot be taught. You're not scary. You will not be continuing in the Scaring Program.
1806: 7.3760824: You're not part of the control group, by the way. You get the gel. Last poor son of a gun got blue paint. Hahaha. All joking aside, that did happen - broke every bone in his legs. Tragic. But informative. Or so I'm told.
1173: 7.3752737: Don't be afraid, go straight on, 'cause no one knows what the future holds. Past regrets and loneliness. I gave it a lot of thought to see the light. I must go on for all time and never return! I have to say goodbye and it's breaking my heart forever. I wish to carry on, but there's so many places in this world. I'm following my destiny, crossing the valleys, the seven seas all over the earth and I'm swearing on my honour to dethrone the prince of the world.
1891: 7.3752737: Don't be afraid, go straight on, 'cause no one knows what the future holds. Past regrets and loneliness. I gave it a lot of thought to see the light. I must go on for all time and never return! I have to say goodbye and it's breaking my heart forever. I wish to carry on, but there's so many places in this world. I'm following my destiny, crossing the valleys, the seven seas all over the earth and I'm swearing on my honour to dethrone the prince of the world.
2239: 7.3742614: After showing us the first three ballet positions she sat down to rest. She took her shoes off. Her toes were showing blood. I noticed then the lines in her face, the traces of gray in her black hair. I felt so sorry for her I decided to go ahead and sign up for her course. But once I left that room, back out into the dust, wind-flurried afternoon, I never did return. Ballet seemed then some terrible misuse of the body.
916: 7.3736076: Baby, love never felt so good. And I'd doubt if it ever could. Not like you hold me, hold me. Oh baby, love never felt so fine. And I'd doubt if it's ever mine. Not like you hold me, hold me. And the night is gonna be just fine. Gotta fly, gotta see, can't believe, I can't take it.
2115: 7.3709683: She came up to me and, putting her hands over my eyes, gently drew my head back upon her shoulder, saying tremulously, "Don't love it so well, Clark, or it may be taken from you. Oh, dear boy, pray that whatever your sacrifice may be, it be not that."
1778: 7.3683805: Science isn't about WHY. It's about WHY NOT. Why is so much of our science dangerous? Why not marry safe science if you love it so much. In fact, why not invent a special safety door that won't hit you on the butt on the way out, because you are fired.
1388: 7.365623: When I'm with you, I hear a sound that makes me laugh and smile and sing to you. When I'm with you, I feel so free. I love that love is going to take control of me. When I'm with you, it's for real. What I feel, when I'm with you. When I'm with you, I wonder why people do stop and stare and smile at us. When I'm with you, the sun shines my way. Baby, our love reflects its rays of light on everyone in the world.
1813: 7.361475: Some emergency testing may require prolonged interaction with lethal military androids. Rest assured that all lethal military androids have been taught to read, and provided with one copy of the Laws of Robotics.
1415: 7.3612614: Well, this can't be right. Lemme see those blueprints. Oh, wait a minute. Those are the plans for a Space Laser-inator, apparently. I was wondering what that thing was for. That must be the laser. Good thing we didn't attach it, huh?
1438: 7.36086: Actually, it's your word against yours. And if you want this pen, you're going to help me find this poor missing otter, or the only place you'll be selling pawpsicles is the prison cafeteria. It's called a hustle, sweetheart.
390: 7.3518147: She inserted a fresh sheet of paper and began. Under her fingers, the keys rattled and clicked. But although she willed the words to wisp up into long silvery tendrils that would wrap around her and take her away, they didn't. They stayed black and blunt on the page. There was no liftoff. None at all.
1325: 7.349422: Oh! Oh! Or we could put state-of-the-art robotic technology in kiddie meals all over the world! Can you hear me okay through that pillow?
286: 7.342343: Okay, may I speak now? Because I happen to be an expert on punishment, and I'm not sure it fits the crime here. I mean, Carver made a mistake - well, several really - but... you're different. He's changed. Doesn't that mean anything to you?
1734: 7.34143: Now I have repaid any debt I may have owed you. You know all that I know. My voice is the only proof that you will have of the truth of any of this. I might have written a letter with my signature, but my handwriting isn't what it used to be. Maybe you've had the presence of mind to record this. That's your prerogative. You will not be contacted by me again. And if you look... you will not find me.
1060: 7.339666: Throughout the entire structure well guarded mazes held the clues to the locations of an incredible array of computing power, some of the world's best analytical tools, test equipment, forensic labs, communications facilities and a staff of experts in hundreds of technical specialties required to investigate crimes that landed in their jurisdiction.
1336: 7.3394403: Oh sure it's a good day for you! Tomorrow's a grand day for you because tomorrow is the day you get a job! Tomorrow is the day you pay the bills, tomorrow is the day you grow up and start acting responsible. But tomorrow never comes for you, does it, Oskar? Because it's so conveniently a day away!
1746: 7.3385234: Haskell is a purely functional programming language. In imperative languages you get things done by giving the computer a sequence of tasks and then it executes them. While executing them, it can change state. In purely functional programming you don't tell the computer what to do as such but rather you tell it what stuff is.
49: 7.3360796: We have learned to fear our planet and fled to the stars in search of a new one. But the fascination for other worlds could not turn my eyes away from the beauty of our home. The waves are crashing on the shore... and the wind is blowing in my hair. Tell them it feels good. Tell them the dark clouds have given way to the ocean mist. Tell them a new world awaits us. Tell them we're waiting for you. Waiting for you to come back.
42: 7.3360558: Breaking News! An update has swept the realm, changing villager life forever. But one villager refuses to embrace our new way of life. Here's Villager Number Nine with more info.
2078: 7.3314447: You talked of subjugation. I answered your violent plea... youth and infatuation kept me too blind to see. You think you're someone's hero, you're hiding more than your eyes. I challenge your weak manifesto, the goal of a savior is not to be lionized.
1625: 7.3269453: Well, I tried squeakin', but I'm still broken. No one could hear me. Besides, the dust aggravates my condition. What's the point in prolonging the inevitable? We're all just one stitch away from here, to there.
1366: 7.324784: Yes! They happened! But this, our family, is what's happening now, Bob. And you are missing this! I can't BELIEVE you don't want to go to your own son's graduation!
2095: 7.32409: Breaking plateaus in anything is a difficult task. Sometimes, a new practice method can help you push through it, and other times, it's just more and more focused practice. My problem was that I was obsessed with speed, but sometimes you gotta take it slow, and refine each and every motion that you're making. That's what let me break through: I had to slow down to go faster.
1404: 7.323645: Okay, Ferb. If we're going to tackle this fashion design thing, we've got to do something really special. It has to be cool, comfortable... and undetectable by radar. Something that absolutely screams summer!
1867: 7.323103: They were crying when their sons left, all young men must go. He's come so far to find the truth, he's never going home. Young men standing on the top of their own graves; wondering when Jesus comes, are they gonna be saved? Cruelty to the winner, bishop tells the king his lies. Maybe you're a mourner, maybe you deserve to die.
2210: 7.3209786: During the design process, it can be unclear how to proceed forward, particularly when team members have mixed opinions. The best way to resolve team conflicts about design elements is to prototype and evaluate them with users. If a prototype is received well, it's a good sign it's worth pursuing further.
2396: 7.3158584: The thing that really surprised me was that it [Earth] projected an air of fragility. And why, I don't know. I don't know to this day. I had a feeling it's tiny, it's shiny, it's beautiful, it's home, and it's fragile.
2223: 7.3158054: He wasn't even a very successful man. He was a poser, a braggart, and a tyrant. But he had held onto his self-respect, he dreamed grand dreams, and he could work well at any task he turned his hand to: he could raise vegetables, sail a boat, plead a case in small claims court, sing Japanese poems, make false teeth, and carve a pig.
411: 7.31155: She walked close to Gatsby, touching his coat with her hand. Jordan and Tom and I got into the front seat of Gatsby's car, Tom pushed the unfamiliar gears tentatively, and we shot off into the oppressive heat, leaving them out of sight behind.
1168: 7.306668: Hello fellow and aspiring typists! Over the years I have spent among my beloved typing community so far, I have noticed that while there's plenty of sources for typing advice available for plenty of people who have sought it, they oftentimes only focus on a few certain aspects of typing as they tend to be pretty short and easy to read, and now and then the suggestions would contradict each other.
1066: 7.305588: Leaving behind her still, on either side, small circles glittering idly in the moon, until they melted all into one track of sparkling light. But now, like one who grows, proud of his skill, to reach a chosen point with an unswerving line, I fixed my view upon the summit of a craggy ridge. The horizon's utmost boundary; far above was nothing but the stars and the grey sky.
2142: 7.302774: And both that morning equally lay in leaves no step had trodden black. Oh, I kept the first for another day! Yet knowing how way leads on to way, I doubted if I should ever come back. I shall be telling this with a sigh. Somewhere ages and ages hence: Two roads diverged in a wood, and I- I took the one less traveled by, and that has made all the difference.
1671: 7.301343: We stand up for our right. Stand up in order to fight. Silence's been broken our anger. Demand an apology to you. Time has come. Fight in the cause of justice. Don't wander in the darkness. No matter what happened, we push ahead confidently. Everything goes just as we want now, go.
941: 7.299449: I want to learn more and more to see as beautiful what is necessary in things; then I shall be one of those who make things beautiful. Amor fati: let that be my love henceforth! I do not want to wage war against what is ugly. I do not want to accuse; I do not even want to accuse those who accuse. Looking away shall be my only negation. And all in all and on the whole: some day I wish to be only a Yes-sayer.
1577: 7.2987742: Carlton, I'd like to come to everything you do. I always come to your tennis matches, to your glee club concerts, to your debate matches. Frankly, keeping up with your extracurricular activities is a 24-hour a day job.
980: 7.296254: Have you seen the two-hundred-foot-long billboards in the country beyond town? Did you know that once billboards were only twenty feet long? But cars started rushing by so quickly they had to stretch the advertising out so it would last.
2271: 7.2961164: Long exposure to spice has given the tribe their characteristic blue eyes, the eyes of Ibad. Little else is known of the Fremen, except that they are dangerous and unreliable. Fremen attack make spice harvesting extremely hazardous.
40: 7.2938595: Can you hear me, Belle? It's me. I know it's only been a short time since I began my journey without you, but it feels like an eternity. I received a letter from Gideon. He's doing well in his studies. Our son misses you, Belle. Terribly. And so do I.
1364: 7.293435: Under tremendous public pressure, and the crushing financial burden of an ever mounting series of lawsuits, the government quietly initiated the superhero relocation program. The supers will be granted amnesty from responsibility for past actions, in exchange for the promise to never again resume hero work.
918: 7.288998: How could you do this to me? I've been a salesman here 18 years. Wendy's only been here two months!? Look, your sales are admittedly better but she has the college degree. What can I do?
1658: 7.2872925: Remember days of yesterday, how it flew so fast. The two score and a year we had, I thought it would always last. Those summer days and west coast dreams, I wished would never end. A young boy and his father, idol, and best friend. I'll always remember - those were the best of times. A lifetime together, I'll never forget. The morning shows on the radio, the case of the missing dog.
1635: 7.287126: Well, now, I'll tell ya. When the kids get old, new ones come in. When they get old, new ones replace them. You'll never be outgrown or neglected, never abandoned or forgotten. No owners means no heartbreak.
2280: 7.2869315: Now if rights are founded in the nature of our moral being, then the mere circumstance of sex does not give to man higher rights and responsibilities, than to woman. To suppose that it does, would be to deny the self-evident truth, that the "physical constitution is the mere instrument of the moral nature."
2031: 7.286575: Safe travels to you and Saphira, Eragon. And remember to watch out for earwigs and wild hamsters. Ferocious things, wild hamsters.
416: 7.28543: You can go the distance, you can run the mile. You can walk straight through hell with a smile. You can be a hero, you can get the gold. Breakin' all the records they thought never could be broke. Do it for your people, do it for your pride. How you ever gonna know if you never even try? Do it for your country, do it for your name, 'cause there's gon' be a day when you're standing in the Hall of Fame.
1729: 7.2797575: I know we've seen a lot of crazy things lately, okay? I know you're still trying to put it all together in a way that makes sense. I just want you to understand that what's next is not a prank, okay? I wouldn't do that to you and I'm not doing that to you. So when you see this, you can't yell or make any noise or run anywhere. I know you probably feel like you're being tricked or made fun of. But you're not. I promise you, you're not.
2109: 7.278024: I'd wave at them and when they returned my salute, I would say something like this: "Howdy-do-well-I-thank-you-where-you-goin?"
256: 7.277234: The world was a terrible place, cruel, pitiless, dark as a bad dream. Not a good place to live. Only in books could you find pity, comfort, happiness - and love. Books loved anyone who opened them, they gave you security and friendship and didn't ask anything in return; they never went away, never, not even when you treated them badly.
1645: 7.276216: In the ancient accounts of the Pythagoreans, it is impossible to distinguish Pythagoras' own thoughts from those of his followers. This is largely because of the members of the religious cults or brotherhoods inspired by Pythagoras regarded it as only proper to attribute anything they came up with to the master himself.
239: 7.27271: If you had to sacrifice many things to protect one, you're more likely to give up and throw it away. Including the relationships you have in your hand now. Because it's precious, because you don't want to lose it, you hide it away and put up a front. That's why everyone lies. But... the biggest liar of all... was me.
418: 7.2719684: Any momentary triumph you think you have gained through argument is really a Pyrrhic victory: The resentment and ill will you will stir up is stronger and lasts longer than any momentary change of opinion. It is much more powerful to get others to agree with you through your actions, without saying a word. Demonstrate, do not explicate.
1831: 7.2712936: Before re-entering a relaxation vault at the conclusion of testing, please take a moment to write down the results of your test. An Aperture Science Reintegration Associate will revive you for an interview when society has been rebuilt.
1775: 7.268968: All right, I've been thinking. When life gives you lemons? Don't make lemonade. Make life take the lemons back! Get mad! I don't want your damn lemons! What am I supposed to do with these?
2041: 7.2666698: You think cooking is a cute job, eh? Like mommy in the kitchen? Well, mommy never had to face the dinner rush where all the meals are different and none are simple with all the different cooking times and they must all arrive at the customer's table at exactly the same time, hot and perfect! Every second counts, and you cannot be mommy!
57: 7.2649903: You know what they say: "For every good battle, you need a good adversary." And I felt that Gnasty, in spite of his misguided nature, was a worthy opponent.
1262: 7.2649126: Oh yeah, but not like this one. This is a quality sound system. Probably all copper wiring, huh? So, uh, where are you from? Singapore? Hong Kong?
898: 7.2629995: Time changed, we're different, but my mind still says redundant things, can I not think? Will you love this part of me? My lover is the day I can't forget. Furthering my distance from you. Realistically I can't leave now but I'm okay as long as you keep me from going crazy, keep me from going crazy.
959: 7.254816: We should be able to overcome anything as long as we work as one! As ambassador for the Marleyan government, I, Willy Tybur, wish for world peace! To the enemy forces of Paradis Island; this is a declaration of war!
1888: 7.2421246: Great Ptah, Khnemu, sacred priest of the temple of Ra and the keeper of truth. Crystalline spheres, the power of light grant us keys to the stars and the secrets of flight. Five shall be as One. We unlock the mysteries of knowledge and technology.
2243: 7.2391915: His brain took him back to a time when he was very little, all bundled up in a snowsuit. He and his mother were walking, hand in hand, mitten in mitten, when they both slipped on some ice and fell and rolled down a snow-covered hillside. They ended up at the bottom of the hill. He remembered he almost cried, but instead he laughed. His mother laughed, too.
155: 7.235705: He saw Forest and understood what Seer had meant. It was an illusion. It was a tangled knot of fears and deceits and dark struggles for power that had disguised itself and almost destroyed everything. Now it was unfolding, like a flower coming into bloom, radiant with possibility.
1667: 7.2354107: Searching for my angel, I know I must believe I'm not wrong. Wanna hear her voice with no hesitation, just can't hear her voice. Searching for my angel. I know I'm sure now I'm not wrong. Wanna hear her voice with no hesitation. Still can't hear her voice.
1552: 7.2346044: 1273 down the Rockefeller street, life is marchin' on, do you feel that? 1273 down the Rockefeller street, everything is more than surreal.
2334: 7.2321434: Breakthrough moments are often the result of many previous actions, which build up the potential required to unleash a major change. For example, bamboo can barely be seen for the first five years as it builds extensive root systems underground before exploding 90 feet into the air within six weeks.
1696: 7.231596: Oh, I just love walking in the rain. There are two types that like this sort of thing. There is the sensitive creative sort who loves the feel of the rain on the face, like it was a washing away of all negative thoughts. Splashing through the puddles gives one a feeling that they are a giant crossing mighty oceans in one step. And of course, there's the other type who's just too dumb to come in out of the rain. Which one are you?
983: 7.227173: Earlier, kids had been playing hopscotch there, on the street that looked like oil-stained pages. When I arrived, I could still hear the echoes. The feet tapping the road. The children-voices laughing, and the smiles like salt, but decaying fast.
1229: 7.223205: If you want a child to share a toy, instead of asking, "Will you share?" ask, "Will you be a sharer?"
1581: 7.2194853: Gordon Freeman in the flesh. Or rather, in the hazard suit. I took the liberty of relieving you of your weapons; most of them were government's property. As for the suit, I think you've earned it. The border world, Xen, is in our control for the time being, thanks to you. Quite a nasty piece of work you managed over there. I am impressed.
181: 7.2186365: The giant amoeba slides along the kitchen floor. Extending a cytoplasmic pseudo pod, the protozoan engulfs a package of oatmeal cookies.
1695: 7.215183: What if a lesser human being - a Cates, or a Darwin - has the audacity to think that God might whisper to him? That an un-Brady thought might still be holy? Must men go to prison because they are at odds with the self-appointed prophet?
1829: 7.211387: By completing all test courses, you have achieved Level C security clearance. You may now access all testing courses and three of Aperture Science's 176 restrooms.
1302: 7.208294: Welcome back. I hope everyone had a pleasant break. Some say that a career as a scream can designer is boring. Unchallenging. A waste of a monster's potential. Open your text books to chapter three. We will now plunge into the rich history of scream can design.
121: 7.207017: Even in the darkest and most cruel person, there is still a kernel of good. And within the most perfect champion, there is darkness. The question is, will one give in to the dark or the light? It's something we decide with every choice we make, every day that we exist. What might not be evil to you could be evil to someone else. Knowing this makes us powerful even without magic.
2370: 7.206073: Everything that lives is designed to end. We are perpetually trapped in a never-ending spiral of life and death. Is this a curse? Or some kind of punishment? I often think about the god who blessed us with this cryptic puzzle... and wonder if we'll ever get the chance to kill him.
991: 7.20375: The further they walk, the more wheelchairs appear until the lawn is jammed with two hundred wheelchairs bumping into each other, patients falling out, total wheelchair chaos.
119: 7.202814: The prophecy of the black foal decreed that the Hundred Year Star would transfer its supernatural fire to the colt at midnight on his first birthday. The star would then disappear for another hundred years, and the black foal would become the most powerful pegasus in Anok.
145: 7.201941: What is the cause of historical events? Power. What is power? Power is the sum total of wills transferred to one person. On what condition are the wills of the masses transferred to one person? On condition that the person express the will of the whole people. That is, power is power. That is, power is a word the meaning of which we do not understand.
1201: 7.193439: As she approached the corner of the barn where the sugar maple stands, she plucked a few blackberries from a stray bush and popped them into her mouth. She looked all around her - back at the house, across the fields, and up into the canopy of branches overhead. She took several quick steps up to the trunk of the maple, threw her arms around it, and kissed that tree soundly.
1450: 7.1915584: Are you from another dimension? Like a parallel universe where things are like this universe but different? And you're Spider-Man in that universe? But somehow traveled to this universe, but you don't know how?
958: 7.189819: She gracefully jumped off the roof of the building, plummeting to the alley below. She rolled into a handspring, vaulting through a broken window into the abandoned warehouse inside. Years of navigating the streets kept her body strong - and her mind sharp.
227: 7.1888766: What do you know of death? Have you ever died? You think death will preserve your cause forever? Ridiculous! Death leaves nothing behind! Once a person passes on, nothing remains but dead bones. If there is one thing I can't stand, it is a person with no respect for life.
1678: 7.187878: Safe in the light that surrounds me, free of the fear and the pain. My subconscious mind starts spinning through time to rejoin the past once again. Nothing seems real, I'm starting to feel lost in the haze of a dream. And as I draw near the scene becomes clear like watching my life on a screen. Hello, Victoria, so glad to see you, my friend.
1918: 7.1870484: They explained that by their studies of the past three months the pigs had succeeded in reducing the principles of Animalism to seven commandments. These seven commandments would now be inscribed on the wall; they would form an unalterable law by which all the animals on Animal Farm must live for ever after.
232: 7.1828117: I don't tip because society says I have to. All right, if someone deserves a tip, if they really put forth an effort, I'll give them a little something extra. But this tipping automatically, it's for the birds. As far as I'm concerned, they're just doing their job.
1748: 7.1786013: Haskell is lazy. That means that unless specifically told otherwise, Haskell won't execute functions and calculate things until it's really forced to show you a result. That goes well with referential transparency and it allows you to think of programs as a series of transformations on data.
2208: 7.174255: When teams struggle to innovate it's often because they neglect to look outside their organization for inspiration. Unlike competitive research, analogies push teams to consider radically different industries and offerings to apply a fresh perspective on a familiar challenge.
1576: 7.173692: Look, I think I know how to help Will. This calls for tough love. We've gotta draw him out, we gotta bait him, confront him, attack him until he defends himself. Only then will he start to feel better. Just follow my lead. Will, you should be ashamed of yourself!
1375: 7.1720195: I know what I said! Remember the bad guys on those shows you used to watch on Saturday mornings? Well, these guys are not like those guys. They won't exercise restraint because you're children. They will kill you if they get the chance. Do not give them that chance.
1584: 7.168363: Rather than offer you the illusion of free choice, I will take the liberty of choosing for you... if and when your time comes around again. I do apologize for what must seem to you an arbitrary imposition, Dr. Freeman. I trust it will all make sense to you in the course of, well, I'm really not at liberty to say. In the meantime, this is where I get off.
1103: 7.167617: Curiously enough, the only thing that went through the mind of the bowl of petunias as it fell was, "Oh no, not again." Many people have speculated that if we knew exactly why the bowl of petunias had thought that we would know a lot more about the nature of the Universe than we do now.
1810: 7.1615114: The lab boys just informed me that I should not have mentioned the control group. They're telling me I oughta stop making these pre-recorded messages. That gave me an idea: make more pre-recorded messages. I pay the bills here, I can talk about the control group all damn day.
1323: 7.161153: Trade up my BF? Ron, I don't care about dating a jock. I care about dating you, Ron Stoppable, no matter who he is - as long as he's honest.
178: 7.159554: Behold the dreaded toboggan: the suicide sled. Its unique design sends a blinding spray of snow on its passengers at the slightest bump. Note, too, the lack of any steering mechanism. Yes, this sled is truly a hazard to life and limb.
1317: 7.1569824: First, you'll be sealed in a reinforced titanium box. Next, you will be dropped into this bottomless chasm. Then, the chasm will be filled with water. Then, man-eating sharks and a giant squid will then be released into the water!
2019: 7.155926: A genius, huh? What does that mean? 'Genius?' So I was not born with a whole lot of natural talent, not gifted like Neji... But I work hard and I never give up! That is my gift; that is my ninja way!
2350: 7.1551356: The chamber of the stone god statue might have been massive, yet its actual inner structure was on the simpler side. On the walls, countless torches could be found there. And in front of these walls, more stone statues, slightly taller than a human being, stood tall and unmoving. There were lots of them here as well, found at a certain distance from one another.
926: 7.154643: Tommy... the thing is you're using words, but the thing about this world, Tommy, is that the only universal language is violence. And we've had that conversation, we've spoken that language in the pit! Onto a new day, a new plot - to destroy Manberg.
162: 7.153571: If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue, or walk with kings - nor lose the common touch, if neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you, if all men count with you, but none too much; if you can fill the unforgiving minute with sixty seconds' worth of distance run, yours is the earth and everything that's in it, and - which is more - you'll be a man, my son!
2373: 7.152432: Supernovae can expel several solar masses of material at speeds up to several percent of the speed of light. This drives expanding shock wave into the surrounding interstellar medium, sweeping up an expanding shell of gas and dust observed as a supernova remnant.
129: 7.152146: After graduating from our school, they went into the Woods expecting epic battles with monsters and wizards, only to find their fairy tales unfold right in their own houses. They didn't realize that villains are the ones closest to us. They didn't realize that to find a happy ending, a hero must first look right under his nose.
829: 7.1481843: Ultimately I don't understand a thing, I try to do the best I can, I know you try to do the same. We're just so bound to make mistakes, you could call it a disposition, I apologize for all your tears, I wish I could be different. But I'm still growing up, into the one you can call your love. I don't know if I'll ever be enough. I'm throwing in my chips, I guess I tend to push my luck.
517: 7.1473174: In comparing rectilinear figures, the method of superposition was employed by the ancients, but in comparing rectilinear and curvilinear figures with each other, this method failed because no addition or subtraction of rectilinear figures could ever produce curvilinear ones.
2194: 7.146924: Among the Japanese, of course, rice is never eaten with sweet foods, only with salty or savory foods. Few of us could eat such a mixture. But at this point no one dared protest. It would have been impolite. I was horrified when I saw the apricot syrup seeping through my little mound of rice.
1928: 7.1451135: Any animal caught singing it was given a flogging on the spot. And yet the song was irrepressible. The blackbirds whistled it in the hedges, the pigeons cooed it in the elms, it got into the din of the smithies and the tune of the church bells. And when the human beings listened to it, they secretly trembled, hearing in it a prophecy of their future doom.
14: 7.142109: If the Enrichment center is currently being bombarded with fireballs, meteorites, or other objects from space, please avoid unsheltered testing areas wherever a lack of shelter from space-debris does not appear to be a deliberate part of the test.
1233: 7.130296: Governments will always play a huge part in solving big problems. They set public policy and are uniquely able to provide the resources to make sure solutions reach everyone who needs them. They also fund basic research, which is a crucial component of the innovation that improves life for everyone.
1637: 7.125273: Listen up, folks. We got a way of doin' things here at Sunnyside. If you start at the bottom, pay your dues, life here can be a dream come true! But if you break our rules, step outta line, try to check out early, well, you're just hurtin' yourselves.
2163: 7.1235046: This is part of what a family is about, not just love, but letting others know there's someone who is watching out for them. It's what I missed so much when my mother died - what I call your 'spiritual security' - knowing that your family will be there watching out for you. Nothing else will give you that. Not money. Not fame.
223: 7.10959: Money is defined in terms of what it does: money is any asset that can easily be used to purchase goods and services. For ease of use, money must be widely accepted by sellers. It is also desirable for money to be durable, portable, uniform, in limited supply, and divisible into smaller units, as with dollars and cents.
2390: 7.1082473: The best way to measure how much you've grown isn't by inches or the number of laps you can now run around the track, or even your grade point average-- though those things are important, to be sure. It's what you've done with your time, how you've chosen to spend your days, and whom you've touched this year. That, to me, is the greatest measure of success.
1562: 7.0966625: You mean we'll all get to live our lives again? Oh, my, yes. Even that nasty robot, what's-his-name. Of course, we won't remember anything that's happened. What do you say? Want to go around again? I do.
1288: 7.09654: Oxygen is the chemical element with the symbol O and atomic number 8. It is a member of the chalcogen group in the periodic table, a highly reactive nonmetal, and an oxidizing agent that readily forms oxides with most elements as well as with other compounds.
389: 7.088542: A story is like a giant jigsaw puzzle, a jigsaw puzzle that would cover the whole floor of a room with its tiny pieces. But it's not the sort of puzzle that comes with a box. There is no lid with a picture on it so that you can see what the puzzle will look like when it's finished. And you have only some of the pieces. All you can do is keep looking and listening, sniffing about in all sorts of places, until you find the next piece.
1971: 7.084813: "That is the true spirit, comrade!" cried Squealer, but it was noticed he cast a very ugly look at Boxer with his little twinkling eyes.
1836: 7.084795: I course backward down the flight of ancestors, hunting along the tributaries, darting into nooks and crannies. You would not recognize many of their names. Who has ever heard of Norma Cenva? I have lived her!
1750: 7.082757: In most imperative languages functions are called by writing the function name and then writing its parameters in parentheses, usually separated by commas. In Haskell, functions are called by writing the function name, a space and then the parameters, separated by spaces.
1586: 7.0786457: I wish I could do more than keep an eye on you, but I have agreed to abide by certain, restrictions. Well, now... Listen carefully, my dear. When you see your father relay these words: Prepare for unforeseen consequences!
1276: 7.0770245: What we now want is closer contact and better understanding between individuals and communities all over the earth, and the elimination of egoism and pride which is always prone to plunge the world into primeval barbarism and strife... Peace can only come as a natural consequence of universal enlightenment.
1465: 7.076839: The best part of my day is when I get thrown off the roof. Because when the Nicelanders lift me up, I get a perfect view of Sugar Rush, and I can see Vanellope racing. The kid's a natural, and the players love her, glitch and all, just like I knew they would.
2083: 7.073768: With this faith, we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope. With this faith, we will be able to transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood. With this faith, we will be able to work together, to pray together, to struggle together, to go to jail together, to stand up for freedom together, knowing that we will be free one day.
2242: 7.0734487: But they all knew, even as they said it, that Papa would never move back east. As bad as the West Coast sounded, it was still his home territory. He was too old to start over, too afraid of rejection in an unknown part of the world, too stubborn and too tired to travel that far, and too proud to do piecework on an assembly line.
1679: 7.0732536: Subconscious strange sensation, unconscious relaxation. What a pleasant nightmare and I can't wait to get there again. Every time I close my eyes there's another vivid surprise. Another whole life waiting, chapters unfinished fading.
2290: 7.071892: I'm not really sure why. But... do you stop loving someone just because they betray you? I don't think so. That's what makes the betrayal hurt so much - pain, frustration, anger... and I still loved her. I still do.
1235: 7.071821: Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma - which is living with the results of other people's thinking. Don't let the noise of others' opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition.
1819: 7.0708222: If you're allergic to peanuts, you might want to tell somebody now, because this next test may turn your blood into peanut water for a few minutes. On the bright side, if we can make this happen, they're gonna have to invent a new type of Nobel Prize to give us, so hang in there.
2251: 7.0695753: In the long history of the world, only a few generations have been granted the role of defending freedom in its hour of maximum danger. I do not shrink from this responsibility - I welcome it. I do not believe that any of us would exchange places with any other people or any other generation. The energy, the faith, the devotion which we bring to this endeavor will light our country and all who serve it - and the flow from that fire can truly light the world.
1994: 7.0691395: There were many more mouths to feed now. In the autumn the four sows had all littered about simultaneously, producing thirty-one young pigs between them. The young pigs were piebald, and as Napoleon was the only boar on the farm, it was possible to guess at their parentage.
2013: 7.0689664: There were shoutings, bangings on the table, sharp suspicious glances, furious denials. The source of the trouble appeared to be that Napoleon and Mr. Pilkington had each played an ace of spades simultaneously.
1887: 7.0667043: Born from the light, journey into the moment delivered from thought and sky. He will be one, one with the land. Lord of wind and the sea and the sands. The one, the bringer of life. All will bear a part of me - let this hollow shell set you free to live as one. Here we are, children of sun and stars. The first to know and to understand. Living by the law of the ages, prophets and sages, forging utopia.
1792: 7.058229: I've got a surprise for you after this next test. Not a fake, tragic surprise like last time. A real surprise, with tragic consequences. And real confetti this time. The good stuff. Our last bag. Part of me's going to miss it, but at the end of the day it was just taking up space.
2270: 7.0579042: Extreme temperatures and treacherous weather events make life outside the cities of Arrakis truly hostile. With sandstorms powerful enough to cut through the metal, only the native tribes known as the Fremen have adapted well enough to survive.
1337: 7.055828: I knew it. You're talking to her, aren't you, Arnold? What is she saying about me? I kept hearing this little click and I knew you were on the other line, to her, talking behind my back. Nadine was always jealous. She's jealous, isn't she, Arnold?
1830: 7.05488: You came back! Didn't actually plan... for that. Can't actually reset the death trap. So. Ah. Could you jump into that pit there? Would you just jump into that pit for me?
89: 7.0543103: China's wine boom has prompted considerable developments in viticulture. Thousands of native grape varieties exist in northern China, many from wild species as breeding is a preoccupation of Chinese research institutions.
1410: 7.053162: As soon as he walks through that front door, no more Perry the Platypus. It's genius right? Oh! I told Nancy to keep the back door locked. Note to self. My evil deed for tomorrow: fire the maid.
1239: 7.0506606: But, uh, I don't have any friends. And I'm not goin' out there by myself. Hey, wait a minute! I got a great idea! I'll stick with you. You're a mean, green, fightin' machine. Together we'll scare the spit out of anybody that crosses us.
1850: 7.0450153: Often people have it wrong, mistakenly believing that showing mercy to an enemy is kindness. They spare the foe whose life is in their hands. But don't you see? It's an empty existence, to go on living, alone and unloved, when defeat's already cost you your dream!
1728: 7.044014: The Weeble's stupid. It can't move. Even if we were to put the Weeble in at point B, it's still going to bounce back and forth until it's kicked out at the B end. But if it were smart... it could enter at the B end and exit at the A end before it flips back.
1445: 7.0417204: Research reveals that the higher you score on an IQ test, the more likely you are to fall for stereotypes, because you're faster at recognizing patterns. And recent experiments suggest that the smarter you are, the more you might struggle to update your beliefs.
183: 7.041533: People always make the mistake of thinking art is created for them. But really, art is a private language for sophisticates to congratulate themselves on their superiority to the rest of the world. As my artist's statement explains, my work is utterly incomprehensible and is therefore full of deep significance.
1889: 7.0407124: Bow down to me, we will never understand, then take my hand and you will see, we will see. You will see paradise, a paradise, of pain and death awaiting for you all, we'll decide the future. Lost evermore the essence of truth, although she tried in vain to bring us peace, it will ever rest in our hands. We've cried a thousand tears for all we had, and all the things we could have been, we must find our way again.
1895: 7.032057: The dark side of the realm, get behind, the secret of the beast. Get behind, you will find my hideout. It's too late all is done, I just bring bloodshed and cries. And the day will come here below when the light will cross my destiny. Domination to succeed to the crown, just remember the man you used to be. Cause when the virus comes it's time for victory.
408: 7.0282497: I told myself they were not gawking curiosity seekers, but scientists here in search of knowledge. They couldn't help finding these pictures funny - but still, as Burt caught the spirit and made amusing comments on the films, I was overcome with a sense of mischief.
96: 7.021983: I call this turf 'n' turf. It's a 16-ounce T-bone and a 24-ounce porterhouse. Also, whiskey and a cigar. I am going to consume all of this at the same time because I am a free American.
1592: 7.0214114: Empty your mind, be formless. Shapeless, like water. If you put water into a cup, it becomes the cup. You put water into a bottle and it becomes the bottle. You put it in a teapot, it becomes the teapot. Now, water can flow or it can crash. Be water, my friend.
165: 7.020024: We caught fish, and talked, and we took a swim now and then to keep off sleepiness. It was kind of solemn, drifting down the big still river, laying on our backs looking up at the stars, and we didn't ever feel like talking loud, and it warn't often that we laughed, only a kind of low chuckle. We had mighty good weather, as a general thing, and nothing ever happened to us at all, that night, nor the next, nor the next.
588: 7.017386: My son. The day you were born the very forests of Lordaeron whispered the name... Arthas.
2147: 7.012254: No harm. No harm! Have they seen what happened to our income? Do they care what the city did to ruin our business? No harm! I suffered plenty of harm and not just because I am paying taxes to support Chrysler instead of the schools.
1611: 7.0107923: I figured it out. You know the ocean used to love when I pulled up islands. 'Cause your ancestors would sail the seas and find them. All those new islands, new villages, it was the water that connected them all. And if I were the ocean, I think I'd be looking for, a curly haired, non-princess to start that again.
2315: 7.009344: This cosmic dance of bursting decadence and withheld permissions twists all our arms collectively, but if sweetness can win, and it can, then I'll still be here tomorrow to high-five you yesterday, my friend. Peace.
1391: 6.9961886: I've been watching you for so very long. Trying to get my nerve built up to be so strong. I really want to meet you, but I'm kind of scared. 'Cause you're the kind of lady with so much class. I get my thoughts together for the very next day. But, when I see you lady, I forget what to say. Your eyes and hair, such a beautiful tone. The way you dress and walk, it really turns me on.
1588: 6.9938335: Mother knows best, listen to your mother, it's a scary world out there. Mother knows best, one way or another, something will go wrong, I swear. Ruffians, thugs, poison ivy, quicksand, cannibals and snakes, the plague.
1338: 6.9927826: Okay. If we're gonna get you off chocolate, we have to figure out why you're so obsessed with it. This is a watch. I want you to watch. It goes back and forth. Watch the watch. Concentrate. Do you like chocolate?
2331: 6.992294: Meanwhile, improving by one percent isn't particularly notable - sometimes it isn't even noticeable - but it can be far more meaningful, especially in the long run. The difference a tiny improvement can make over time is astounding.
76: 6.989727: Over these last two nights, you've drawn an outline of a person. A person who doesn't think about others, a person who puts his own needs first. And over and over, other people get hurt, not necessarily because he means to hurt them, but because he just doesn't care. This person I'm describing, is it a different person, or is it you?
1599: 6.989564: Self-actualization is the important thing. And my personal message to people is that I hope they will go towards self-actualization rather than self-image actualization. I hope that they will search within themselves for honest self-expression.
1644: 6.9889636: Now, Woody, he's been my pal for as long as I can remember. He's brave, like a cowboy should be. And kind. And smart. But the thing that makes Woody special is he'll never give up on you. Ever. He'll be there for you, no matter what. You think you can take care of him for me?
1054: 6.987824: If someone is turning a knob on an oscilloscope, then if he's carefully adjusting it, he is probably tweaking it; if he is just turning it but looking at the screen, he is probably twiddling it; but if he's just doing it because turning a knob is fun, he's frobbing it.
1735: 6.9873314: However, know when to be inconsistent - sometimes style guide recommendations just aren't applicable. When in doubt, use your best judgement. Look at other examples and decide what looks best. And don't hesitate to ask!
2295: 6.9841614: Hikari examines their field of battle. It has been torn asunder, and now looks more a wasteland than ever before. Ripped, ruined all through, like a town in the aftermath of military bombardment. The glass around them is uncountable.
1257: 6.9794393: Tuesday night's plastic corrosion awareness meeting, was I think, a big success. We'd like to thank Mr. Spell for putting that on for us. Thank you Mr. Spell.
1780: 6.9767838: All these science spheres are made of asbestos, by the way. Keeps out the rats. Let us know if you feel a shortness of breath, a persistent dry cough or your heart stopping. Because that's not part of the test. That's asbestos.
138: 6.975274: In fact, I've essentially given up on the idea of flight altogether and accepted that I'm going to be an angel-blood who stays earthbound, a flightless bird, like an ostrich. Maybe, or in this weather, a penguin.
1102: 6.9749055: Mockingbirds don't do one thing except make music for us to enjoy. They don't eat up people's gardens, don't nest in corn cribs, they don't do one thing but sing their hearts out for us. That's why it's a sin to kill a mockingbird.
1248: 6.9709: Blue orchids bloom through the city streets at night, into starlight we call out "We're still here, can you hear me?"
2133: 6.970568: If someone is waxing philosophical about the market, you can say: "The great mistake made by the public is paying attention to prices instead of values."
976: 6.970225: Hero? No! We're pirates! I love heroes, but I don't wanna be one! Do you know what heroes are? Say there is a chunk of meat. Pirates will have a banquet and eat it, but heroes will share it with other people. I want all the meat!
591: 6.9687166: What I like about you is that you're passionate! You're analytical! It doesn't matter what it is, you care about it! 100 percent! At maximum power!
186: 6.9670677: Before my eyes, it blocks my path. A high, high wall. What sort of scene is on the other side? What will I be able to see there? "The view from the top." A scenery I will never be able to see on my own. But if I'm not alone, then... I might be able to see it.
1825: 6.9659824: Right. Now, you might be asking yourself, "Cave, just how difficult are these tests? What was in that phone book of a contract I signed? Am I in danger?"
1848: 6.9653583: Man seeks peace, yet at the same time yearning for war. Those are the two realms belonging solely to man. Thinking of peace whilst spilling blood is something that only humans could do. They're two sides of the same coin. To protect something, another must be sacrificed.
2029: 6.9638715: You taught me the courage of stars before you left: how light carries on endlessly, even after death. With shortness of breath, you explained the infinite and how rare and beautiful it is to even exist. I couldn't help but ask for you to say it all again. I tried to write it down, but I could never find a pen. I'd give anything to hear you say it one more time: that the universe was made just to be seen by my eyes.
1436: 6.9604535: Cry, little baby bunny! Cry, cry... Aw, you don't know when to quit, do you? I want you to remember this moment, the next time you think you'll ever be anything more than just a stupid carrot-farming dumb bunny!
1616: 6.954973: It's hard to believe that I couldn't see, you were always there beside me. Thought I was alone, with no one to hold, but you were always right beside me. This feeling's like no other. I want you to know, I never had someone, that knows me like you do, the way you do. I've never had someone, as good for me as you, no one like you. So lonely before, I finally found, what I've been looking for.
404: 6.9463906: I'm a shooting star leaping through the sky like a tiger defying the laws of gravity. I'm a racing car passing by like Lady Godiva. I'm gonna go, go, go. There's no stopping me.
2126: 6.943954: When the gray skies take the colors away, I'll paint a rainbow lasting for days and days just like the magic that you always shared with me. Maybe now you need to believe. As the hands of time progress, it's so easy to forget the miracle that helped you bring me to life. Oh, there will always be a tomorrow; you'll never have to be alone!
1208: 6.943599: From that day forward Impey Barbicane became one of the greatest citizens of the United States, a kind of Washington of Science. A single trait of feeling, taken from many others, will serve to show the single point which this homage of a whole people to a single individual attained.
1579: 6.9432087: That diet and exercise regimen your mother put me on has really changed my life. It's nice having her home more. She wakes up cheerful every morning, leaves little love notes in my briefcase, calls me up at work just to chat. That woman must be stopped!
896: 6.9422: Gary now I know I was wrong, I messed up, and now you're gone. Gary I'm sorry I neglected you, oh I never expected you to run away and leave me feeling this empty. Your meow right now would sound like music to me. Please come home 'cause I miss you Gary. Gary come home.
1269: 6.939951: You are my fire, the one desire. Believe when I say, I want it that way. But we are two worlds apart. Can't reach to your heart, when you say, that I want it that way. Tell me why, ain't nothing but a heartache. Tell me why, ain't nothing but a mistake. Tell me why, I never wanna hear you say, I want it that way.
1969: 6.9392495: The plot was for Snowball, at the critical moment, to give the signal for flight and leave the field to the enemy. And he very nearly succeeded - I will even say, comrades, he would have succeeded if it had not been for our heroic Leader, Comrade Napoleon.
1762: 6.9359994: Because Haskell supports infinite lists, our recursion doesn't really have to have an edge condition. But if it doesn't have it, it will either keep churning at something infinitely or produce an infinite data structure, like an infinite list.
2169: 6.930134: The boy stood up. He was the filthiest human I had ever seen. His neck was dark gray, the backs of his hands were rusty, and his fingernails were black deep into the quick. He peered at Miss Caroline from a fist-sized clean space on his face.
140: 6.9271917: I've spent a lifetime practicing, becoming who I must be to survive. Hiding in plain sight, always acting, always playing a part. There are times when I fear that I'll lose me, my true self, in the haze of the facade. But that fear doesn't matter to anyone besides myself.
1335: 6.9258456: For Pete's sake, are you that cold? Look into your heart. Now we've got a choice: either you and I work all night to find a certain lost daughter or you can leave now. But if you leave now, that little football-headed kid will never believe in miracles again.
1040: 6.925243: Military preparations must be preceded by so many tedious discussions, arising from the jealousies, pride, separate views, and clashing pretensions of sovereign bodies, that before the diet can settle the arrangements, the enemy are in the field; and before the federal troops are ready to take it, are retiring into winter quarters.
2071: 6.924562: I have come ten million miles, and traveled on your Earth. And with his hands, the fiery beast may consummate my birth. Locust, flies, and disgusting beasts shall crack the ocean floor. Has given life to fiery hands, that open up the door.
1743: 6.9230824: The bus was entering the cobbled courtyard of an enormous, gloomy building that seemed to be an old convent in a forest of colossal trees. The passengers, just visible in the dim light of a lamp in the courtyard, sat motionless until the woman with the military air ordered them out of the bus with the kind of primitive directions used in nursery school.
1115: 6.9204335: We should strive to welcome change and challenges, because they are what help us grow. Without them, we grow weak like the Eloi in comfort and security. We need to constantly be challenging ourselves in order to strengthen our character and increase our intelligence.
1341: 6.919561: Phoebe, over the last week, you've screamed at kids in the halls, you've rationed water at the drinking fountain... you've given out more tickets than a lottery! I mean, look around! Half of our class is sitting here in detention!
2135: 6.9195094: Here is what to do with hot tips. If you get a hot tip, make a note of it and pretend to be very interested. But don't buy. If the thing takes off, listen a little more closely the next time this fellow has a tip. If it gets mauled, look bitter the next time you see him. He will assume that you bought the stock; he will feel guilty; and he will buy you a very nice lunch.
30: 6.919152: Voodoo One, Viper's on station. Your journey ends here, Pilot - the skies belong to me. Nowhere to run... Nowhere to hide.
832: 6.91718: I love you all the same, it's just a situation. Don't let it get between what we want, yeah, what we could be. I love you more each day. Sometimes I can't explain it but I feel it and I don't want that to change. I'm just dreaming, I know you're thinking, that the summer left us behind. I'll be waiting, I might be crazy, but I think that it's worth my time.
1759: 6.9138994: A guard is basically a boolean expression. If it evaluates to True, then the corresponding function body is used. If it evaluates to False, checking drops through to the next guard and so on.
2267: 6.911399: Vision? What do you know about my vision? My vision would turn your world upside down, tear asunder your illusions, and send the sanctuary of your own ignorance crashing down around you. Now ask yourself, are you ready to see that vision?
1760: 6.901912: Like the name implies, case expressions are, well, expressions, much like if/else expressions and let bindings. Not only can we evaluate expressions based on the possible cases of the value of a variable, we can also do pattern matching.
157: 6.8996334: I was looking for myself and asking everyone except myself questions which I, and only I, could answer. It took me a long time and much painful boomeranging of my expectations to achieve a realization everyone else appears to have been born with: That I am nobody but myself.
2186: 6.898666: Days passed with no sight of the comet, or even a single planet. Instead, asteroids extended for as far as the eye could see. "If I had known it was going to take this long, I would have packed more jam," said the little girl, above the rumble of her belly.
2381: 6.898499: Earth changed in the black sky. It caught fire. Part of it seemed to come apart in a million pieces, as if a gigantic jigsaw puzzle had exploded. It had burned with an unholy dripping glare for a minute, three times normal size, then dwindled.
2322: 6.897584: The cerebellum plays a key role in forming and storing the implicit memories created by classical conditioning. With a damaged cerebellum, people cannot develop certain reflexes, such as associating a tone with an impending puff of air.
1350: 6.8958063: Okay, here's the truth. You know that kid they're looking for? Sulley let her in! We tried to get her back but Waternoose had a secret plot and now Randall's right behind us, and he's trying to kill us!
1642: 6.894323: Everyone, listen! Sunnyside could be cool and groovy if we treated each other fair. It's Lotso. He's made us into a pyramid, and he put himself on top!
1307: 6.8937125: Try the demands of raising Rufus as a single parent? Not to mention the pressures of maintaining my image. Okay, so I don't exactly have an image yet; but I'm working on it. And frankly, it's exhausting!
1795: 6.8930583: Oh thank god. You saved my bacon, pal. Where are we going? Is this a jailbreak? Can't see a thing.
234: 6.892386: They followed Saphira's directions and found her drinking from a stream at the base of a small cliff, the elf still slouched on her back. Saphira greeted them with a soft bugle as Eragon dismounted.
1606: 6.8859744: Yeah, it almost sounds like you don't like me, which is impossible because I got stuck here for a thousand years, trying to get the heart as a gift for you mortals so you could have the power to create life itself. Yeah, so what I believe you were trying to say is, "Thank you."
888: 6.8855696: One job forever? That's an insane choice to have to make. I'm relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life. But, Adam, how could they never have told us that? Why would you question anything? We're bees.
1886: 6.883511: Was I sure of my fateful wish to evoke the night from the day? Thousands now join as one - be afraid. What have I done? Clouds are dimming the sun with his wrath of disease and decay. This masque of vengeance leads my death parade.
1172: 6.883511: Was I sure of my fateful wish to evoke the night from the day? Thousands now join as one - be afraid. What have I done? Clouds are dimming the sun with his wrath of disease and decay. This masque of vengeance leads my death parade.
75: 6.8831325: I know. I mean, I know, but I don't always know, you know? Like, sometimes I have this tiny voice in the back of my head that goes, like, "Hey, everyone hates you! And they're not wrong to feel that way!"
2388: 6.8767924: As the harbor shrinks, growing fainter in the distance, severing you forever from this strange, newly formed nation called the United States, you haven't the slightest idea after years of war which of these names fits, or what the future holds, though on one matter you are clear: From the start, you were fighting for no one but yourself.
2299: 6.873971: And now, instincts begin to lurch, old and forgotten, in the wake of those thoughts. They haven't yet taken hold, those discarded and practical sensibilities. They have only stirred. She is still afraid. She clings to hope by a little finger.
1920: 6.87378: In the end they finished the harvest in two days less time than it had usually taken Jones and his men. Moreover, it was the biggest harvest that the farm had ever seen. There was not wastage whatever; the hens and ducks with their sharp eyes had gathered up the very last stalk. And not an animal on the farm had stolen so much as a mouthful.
982: 6.8708982: After school started at the end of August we still went out a couple times more. But something happened. I don't know what. He didn't say anything. He didn't give me any warning. He just stopped picking me up. One day he didn't come for me anymore.
1782: 6.8681: Did you put a virus in them? It's not going to work either. I've got a firewall, mate. Literally, actually, now that I look around. There appears to be literally a wall of fire around this place. Alarming. To say the least.
68: 6.867723: What's going on here? According to my illegal key logging software, you've all been giving out personal information over the Internet. If Hermes were here, he'd fire you all.
266: 6.8675: Tell them only that the Lich King is dead and that Bolvar Fordragon, died with him! Now go - leave this place and never return!
1108: 6.863747: He pointed to a smallish, dark, well-dressed man who was bustling along the other side of the road. As we watched him he looked across at a boy who was bawling out the latest edition of the evening paper, and running over among the cabs and busses, he bought one from him. Then, clutching it in his hand, he vanished through a door-way.
1359: 6.862627: Can we talk? You always say be true to yourself, but you never say which part of yourself to be true to. Well, I've finally figured out who I am. I am your ward... IncrediBoy!
2286: 6.8606205: How many roads must a man walk down before you call him a man? How many seas must a white dove sail before she sleeps in the sand? Yes, and how many times must the cannonballs fly before they're forever banned? The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind.
1967: 6.8569837: But we were all wrong, comrades. Do you know what the real reason was? Snowball was in league with Jones from the very start! He was Jones's secret agent all the time. It has all been proved by documents which he left behind him and which we have only just discovered.
1997: 6.8554955: In April, Animal Farm was proclaimed a Republic, and it became necessary to elect a President. There was only one candidate, Napoleon, who was elected unanimously.
1301: 6.855415: Good afternoon. As a student, I created these games as a friendly competition. But be prepared... to take home the trophy, you must be the most fearsome monsters on campus. Good luck, and may the best monsters win.
2154: 6.8491106: Once, he brought a tango tape and got them to play it over the speakers. Then he commandeered the floor, shooting back and forth like some hot Latin lover. When he finished, everyone applauded. He could have stayed in that moment forever.
1372: 6.8482513: It's finally ready! You know, I went through quite a few supers to get it worthy to fight you, but man, it wasn't good enough! After you trashed the last one, I had to make some major modifications. Sure it was difficult, but you are worth it. I mean, after all... I am your biggest fan.
1540: 6.8453307: Remember the day I set you free, I told you, you could always count on me, darling. From that day on, I made a vow. I'll be there when you want me, someway, somehow. Oh, baby there ain't no mountain high enough, ain't no valley low enough, ain't no river wide enough, to keep me from getting to you, babe.
1811: 6.8348417: If you've cut yourself at all in the course of these tests, you might have noticed that your blood is pure gasoline. That's normal. We've been shooting you with an invisible laser that's supposed to turn blood into gasoline, so all that means is, it's working.
943: 6.8335876: According to Greek mythology, humans were originally created with four arms, four legs and a head with two faces. Fearing their power, Zeus split them into two separate parts, condemning them to spend their lives in search of their other halves.
1718: 6.833076: It comes and goes in waves, it always does; we watch as our young hearts fade into the flood, into the flood. The freedom of falling a feeling I thought was set in stone it slips through my fingers. I'm trying hard to let go. It comes and goes in waves. It comes and goes in waves... And it carries us away.
1852: 6.8318763: On a scale from one to zero, are you happy? Cause you're on your own from here, so are you happy? I'm open to suggestions, are you happy? But what kind of question is "Am I happy?"
2372: 6.8317447: Suddenly he stopped. There was an answer, or so he thought; but it seemed to come from behind him, away down the path further back in the Forest. He turned round and listened, and soon there could be no doubt; someone was singing a song; a deep glad voice was singing carelessly and happily, but it was singing nonsense.
419: 6.829624: Man is the only creature that consumes without producing. He does not give milk, he does not lay eggs, he is too weak to pull the plough, he cannot run fast enough to catch rabbits. Yet he is lord of all the animals. He sets them to work, he gives back to them the bare minimum that will prevent them from starving, and the rest he keeps for himself.
209: 6.8277826: Even if we've come this far in the tournament, in sports there is no way to know what might happen. You might be asked to go and play at any moment. Are you prepared for that mentally? Because I'm going to treat this game as any other official match and give you signs with that in mind. Let's take them down!
222: 6.8206058: Complements are usually goods that in some sense are consumed together: computers and software, cookies and milk, cars and gasoline. Because consumers like to consume a good and its complement together, a change in the price of one of the goods will affect the demand for its complement.
2056: 6.8184648: This planet has - or rather had - a problem, which was this: most of the people living on it were unhappy for pretty much of the time. Many solutions were suggested for this problem, but most of these were largely concerned with the movement of small green pieces of paper, which was odd because on the whole it wasn't the small green pieces of paper that were unhappy.
2203: 6.817549: We know this is a dangerous test - for some fail as extraordinarily as others pass. It is a gamble, risky and promising. It may pay off in unmet eyes or a curious state, surly dismissals or a question, dialogue or bruises.
284: 6.817325: It was one of those less lowering, but still grey and gloomy enough mornings of the transition, when with a fair wind the ship was rushing through the water with a vindictive sort of leaping and melancholy rapidity, that as I mounted to the deck at the call of the forenoon watch, so soon as I levelled my glance towards the taffrail, foreboding shivers ran over me.
2114: 6.816568: As for myself, I saw my aunt's misshapen figure with that feeling of awe and respect with which we behold explorers who have left their ears and fingers north of Franz Josef Land, or their health somewhere along the Upper Congo.
2097: 6.816396: Whether you play shooters or rhythm games, or it's another skill like an instrument or sport, it is so important that you analyze your own weaknesses and mistakes and make the most of the time you spend practicing. Twenty minutes of focused practice is so much more productive than an hour of aimless practice.
1311: 6.815628: Whoa. I may have done a tiny bit of rephrasing but, come on; you'd think a crime-fighting cheerleader would give a more interesting interview. The paper liked my story so much, they're giving me a column!
397: 6.8136253: Engage people with what they expect; it is what they are able to discern and confirms their projections. It settles them into predictable patterns of response, occupying their minds while you wait for the extraordinary moment - that which they cannot anticipate.
1749: 6.810645: Haskell is statically typed. When you compile your program, the compiler knows which piece of code is a number, which is a string and so on. That means that a lot of possible errors are caught at compile time. If you try to add together a number and a string, the compiler will whine at you.
924: 6.8079233: You can't do anything without certainty. The world won't wait for your certainty. You need companions who will open doors without hesitation. And... Don't you wanna protect those eyes, that don't know doubt.
1595: 6.8077207: Love is like a friendship caught on fire. In the beginning a flame, very pretty, often hot and fierce, but still only light and flickering. As love grows older, our hearts mature and our love becomes as coals, deep-burning and unquenchable.
1042: 6.8075237: There are few scenes more gratifying than a spring plowing in that country, where the furrows of a single field often lie a mile in length, and the brown earth, with such a strong, clean smell, and such a power of growth and fertility in it, yields itself eagerly to the plow; rolls away from the shear, not even dimming the brightness of the metal, with a soft, deep sigh of happiness.
73: 6.8042216: You step outside, you risk your life. You take a drink of water, you risk your life. And nowadays you breathe, and you risk your life. Every moment now... you don't have a choice. The only thing you can choose is what you're risking it for.
1972: 6.80253: He turned to go, then paused and added impressively: 'I warn every animal on this farm to keep his eyes very wide open. For we have reason to think that some of Snowball's secret agents are lurking among us at this moment!'
1756: 6.8022156: Tuples are much more rigid because each different size of tuple is its own type, so you can't write a general function to append an element to a tuple - you'd have to write a function for appending to a pair, one function for appending to a triple, one function for appending to a 4-tuple, etc.
2191: 6.800093: This lake of fire burns my skin. How could love wear so thin? I'm sinking in the hollow ground; nothing can stop me wanting you somehow. I won't let it die; I can feel you when you're not around. When the night gets cold, I won't be alone. We won't be alone.
37: 6.7994747: Apart from the excruciating pain, this is great! I've been waiting for a mighty Vault Hunter to help me reach Sanctuary. I will be your wise leader, and you shall be my fearsome minion!
94: 6.7993817: I don't like loud noises and people making a fuss and I especially don't like people celebrating because they know a piece of private information about me. Plus, the whole thing is a scam. Birthdays were invented by Hallmark to sell cards.
1716: 6.79392: Man seeks peace, yet at the same time yearning for war. Those are the two realms belonging solely to man. Thinking of peace whilst spilling blood is something that only humans could do. They're two sides of the same coin, to protect something, another must be sacrificed.
1354: 6.792157: Of course I have a secret identity. Can you see me in this at the supermarket? Come on. Who'd want to go shopping as Elastigirl, y'know what I mean?
2237: 6.791919: Maybe I made a mistake yesterday, but yesterday's me is still me. I am who I am today, with all my faults. Tomorrow I might be a tiny bit wiser, and that's me, too. These faults and mistakes are what I am, making up the brightest stars in the constellation of my life. I have come to love myself for who I was, who I am, and who I hope to become.
1333: 6.7899556: The worst part is, I did this to myself! If only I had left what I wrote on the wall, if only I wasn't so gutless, maybe Arnold would be cosying up to me, instead of that Little Miss Perfect phony Lila.
883: 6.784463: I can't put a patty on a bun with lettuce, cheese, onions, tomatoes, ketchup, mustard, pickles, and top bun together in that order!
1786: 6.782411: Bad news is we're postponing those tests indefinitely. Good news is we've got a much better test for you: fighting an army of mantis men. Pick up a rifle and follow the yellow line. You'll know when the test starts.
2245: 6.7803793: His fingers worked below her shoulder blades. He had found the knot, the tension node, and he homed in on it with a practiced knuckle. Mama rolled her head from side to side, pulling at the tendons in her neck, groaning loudly now, hissing with painful pleasure of his cure.
1348: 6.778531: Carefully matching every child to their ideal monster, to produce superior scream refined into clean, dependable energy. Every time you turn something on Monsters, Incorporated, is there.
159: 6.7714386: And I defend because in spite of all I find that I love. In order to get some of it down I have to love. I sell you no phony forgiveness, I'm a desperate man - but too much of your life will be lost, its meaning lost, unless you approach it as much through love as through hate. So I approach it through division so I denounce and I defend and I hate and I love.
100: 6.7708197: You choose a thankless job. You can't be upset when nobody thanks you. Don't start chasing applause and acclaim. That way lies madness.
1851: 6.7682385: Are you feeling nervous? Are you having fun? It's almost over, it's just begun. Don't overthink this, look in my eye. Don't be scared, don't be shy. Come on in, the water's fine.
1481: 6.7679133: I know not who you are, or how I came to find you, but may I just say... Hi, how ya doin'? The name's Flynn Rider. How's your day goin', huh?
1768: 6.7661576: A Haskell module is a collection of related functions, types and typeclasses. A Haskell program is a collection of modules where the main module loads up the other modules and then uses the functions defined in them to do something.
1979: 6.7656407: In "Beasts of England" we expressed our longing for a better society in days to come. But that society has now been established. Clearly this song has no longer any purpose.
2172: 6.765332: His white shirt bobbed over the back fence and slowly grew larger. He came up the back steps, latched the door behind him, and sat on his cot. Wordlessly, he held up his pants. He lay down, and for a while I heard his cot trembling. Soon he was still. I did not hear him stir again.
1656: 6.763148: Help me be a channel of thy peace. That where there is hatred, I may bring love. That where there is wrong, I may bring the spirit of forgiveness. That where there is discord, I may bring harmony. That where there is error, I may bring truth. That where there is doubt, I may bring faith.
2344: 6.7605557: Now normally, we're supposed to relay this information back to the Association and wait for their decision first, but... But, if we do that, we might end up handing over the task of killing the boss to other Hunters, and our takings for today's raid would decrease by a lot.
46: 6.7576094: Here's a little gift to thank you for all your help! I'm supposed to be steering the ship right now, but I had to write this before I forgot. Anyway, I see a big rock up ahead, so I'd better wrap this up. Bye! Love, Gulliver.
207: 6.756556: Overconfidence leads to hubris, while too much humility results in servility. So from now, I want you to keep walking like you did until now, keeping your feet firmly planted on the ground. I'm looking forward to your next performance.
36: 6.7552743: Harry, I'm going to let you in on a little secret. Every day, once a day, give yourself a present. Don't plan it. Don't wait for it. Just let it happen. It could be a new shirt at the men's store, a catnap in your office chair, or two cups of good, hot black coffee.
92: 6.7458143: I've been quite open about this around the office: I don't want this park's department to build any parks, because I don't believe in government. I think that all government is a waste of taxpayer money. My dream is to have the park system privatized and run entirely for profit by corporations.
1498: 6.741961: With all the strength of a raging fire, mysterious as the dark side of the moon. Time is racing toward us till the Huns arrive. Heed my every order and you might survive. You're unsuited for the rage of war, so pack up, go home, you're through. How could I make a man out of you?
2220: 6.7406287: It can be a hearty or plaintive tune, depending on your mood. From Papa, that night, it was a deep-throated lament. Almost invisible in the stove's small glow, tears began running down his face.
2338: 6.7386785: Imagine you have a messy room and you set a goal to clean it. If you summon the energy to tidy up, then you will have a clean room - for now. But if you maintain the same sloppy, pack-rat habits that led to a messy room in the first place, soon you'll be looking at a new pile of clutter and hoping for another burst of motivation.
59: 6.738286: My tactical instincts told me the Sorceress would attack you here, so I flew in to help out. It seems my rocket launchers don't affect this creature, but I can assist you by dropping ammunition. Now get in there and fight the good fight!
2089: 6.736696: There are a few videos and articles on the internet of people learning these alternate layouts - they're fine, my only problem with them is the fact that they never really get to a words per minute that I would consider as mastery - and sometimes, they don't even talk about their peak speed at all.
111: 6.7356343: There's much more. There's all that goes beyond - all that is elsewhere - and all that goes back, and back, and back. I received all of those, when I was selected. And here in this room, all alone, I re-experience them again and again. It is how wisdom comes. And how we shape our future.
1401: 6.7322397: Okay, boys. Let's have a fair and square fight and in no way should this ensuing fight contain the image of a potentially harmful, hurtful, or psychologically disturbing physical act that could be imitable by an impressionable child viewer.
1051: 6.730703: A person of merely average analytical intelligence who has this trait can become an effective hacker, but a creative genius who lacks it will swiftly find himself outdistanced by people who routinely upload the contents of thick reference manuals into their brains.
2236: 6.72394: My mother, she brought a smile to my face every day. In a life so ordinary and full of struggles for being poor, it was her that was extraordinary. As nature turns seed and water to flower, mother turned the normal things into fascination and love; she was my happiness, my hero. Still, for some reason, I feel empty now.
1221: 6.723816: Sorry, a trick is nothing but a puzzle mankind came up with. If you use your head, you can uncover the logical answer. It's disappointing. No matter the explanation I think of, I cannot understand why one person would kill another. Even if I can see why, I can't understand why.
1409: 6.7213135: Any last noises, Perry the Platypus? You know, that little chirping silly noise that you make? That's the one.
127: 6.7204185: Everyone is guilty of something, and everyone still harbors a memory of childhood innocence, no matter how many layers of life wrap around it. Humanity is innocent; humanity is guilty, and both states are undeniably true.
196: 6.720153: Everyone thinks that being small is more detrimental than it actually is. Even though being smaller puts you at a disadvantage in volleyball, it doesn't make you completely helpless!
1321: 6.716954: Ah, quite right Shego! Time for us to escape and seal the pathways leaving Kim Possible and Company trapped forever!
1340: 6.7167554: Yeah, me, too. Look at these! One for walking too fast, one for walking too slow, one for turning a corner too sharply, one for turning too wide, one for squeaky shoes, one for suspiciously quiet shoes. And these are from this morning.
2001: 6.7134466: That night there was the sound of uproarious singing, which was followed by what sounded like a violent quarrel and ended at about eleven o'clock with a tremendous crash of glass. No one stirred in the farmhouse before noon on the following day, and the word went round that from somewhere or other the pigs had acquired the money to buy themselves another case of whisky.
1177: 6.708486: I really looked up to him. He's smart, and the way he talks, you really believe that he's a good person, that everything he does is to protect his family, his home, or all of humanity. He makes you think that as long as you do what he says, you must be doing the right thing. Even when he asks you to do something bad. Something... evil.
1453: 6.708477: If I don't turn off the collider after you leave, everyone in this city, my parents, my uncle, and millions of others, will die. And you're just going to go home and leave me here to figure this out for myself? You good with that, Spider-Man?
2258: 6.7045784: Foolishness, Dante. Foolishness. Might controls everything. And without strength you can not protect anything. Let alone yourself.
1942: 6.70447: Benjamin was the only animal who did not side with either faction. He refused to believe either that food would become more plentiful or that the windmill would save work. Windmill or no windmill, he said, life would go on as it had always gone on - that is, badly.
45: 6.7035036: Leaves from the vine, falling so slow. Like fragile tiny shells, drifting in the foam. Little soldier boy, come marching home. Brave soldier boy, comes marching home.
1945: 6.703021: The animals would still assemble on Sunday mornings to salute the flag, sing "Beasts of England" and receive their orders for the week; but there would be no more debates.
1799: 6.7026844: Here's an interesting fact: you're not breathing real air. It's too expensive to pump this far down. We just take carbon dioxide out of the room, freshen it up a little, and pump it back in. So you'll be breathing the same room full of air for the rest of your life. I thought that was interesting.
104: 6.702003: If there really is a complete unified theory that governs everything, it presumably also determines your actions. But it does so in a way that is impossible to calculate for an organism that is as complicated as a human being. The reason we say that humans have free will is because we can't predict what they will do.
106: 6.702003: If there really is a complete unified theory that governs everything, it presumably also determines your actions. But it does so in a way that is impossible to calculate for an organism that is as complicated as a human being. The reason we say that humans have free will is because we can't predict what they will do.
2: 6.69407: As long as these Pants are Square, and this Sponge is Bob, I will not let Bikini Bottom down!
1226: 6.6936584: Why do grownups quarrel so easily, so much, and over the most idiotic things? Up till now I thought that only children squabbled and that that wore off as you grew up. Of course, there is sometimes a real reason for a quarrel, but this is just plain bickering.
2070: 6.6936073: Can you hear the whispers all across the room? You feel her eyes all over you like cheap perfume. You're beautiful, but misunderstood - so why you're tryna' be just like the neighborhood?
23: 6.6909704: For one trillion years I've been trapped in my own decaying dimension, waiting for a new universe to call my own. Name's Bill! But you can call me your new lord and master for all of eternity!
2022: 6.6905036: You were wrong on two counts. Even the hardest substance can be broken, when crashed into it. And the ability to feel pain is not a weakness. It's a strength. Pain tells a creature, its vulnerabilities.
1383: 6.6892343: Behold, the Underminer! I am always beneath you, but nothing is beneath me! I hereby declare war on peace and happiness. Soon all will tremble... before ME!
1123: 6.6858916: I no longer believed in the idea of soul mates, or love at first sight. But I was beginning to believe that a very few times in your life, if you were lucky, you might meet someone who was exactly right for you. Not because he was perfect, or because you were, but because your combined flaws were arranged in a way that allowed two separate beings to hinge together.
1755: 6.6853523: A list of numbers is a list of numbers. That's its type and it doesn't matter if it has only one number in it or an infinite amount of numbers. Tuples, however, are used when you know exactly how many values you want to combine and its type depends on how many components it has and the types of the components.
2132: 6.6814466: You are not machines! You are not cattle! You are men! You have the love of humanity in your hearts! You don't hate! Only the unloved hate - the unloved and the unnatural!
1259: 6.6814404: How dare you open a spaceman's helmet on an uncharted planet! My eyeballs could've been sucked from their sockets!
1440: 6.6780715: No, I am a cop. And I'm on the Emmitt Otterton case, and my evidence puts him in your car! So intimidate me all you want, I'm gonna find out what you did to that otter if it's the last thing I do.
2265: 6.6775928: But I wish that just once more I could sit in a straight-backed wicker chair on that platform on the side of a hill in Colorado. I wish that just once more I could look up at the ridges, breathe in the fragrance of the pines, hear the gasping notes from that old pump organ and see the faces of the friends of my youth. I wish just once more, I could sing - on that hill far away.
2362: 6.677197: What happened to you? "I'm not sure. I tried to buy some tacos and wound up getting paid twenty dollars to swim in a vat of Mountain Dew."
586: 6.672585: Ah... all Men desire to live by a Code, or a Creed, yes? Yet when pressed, most defer to their instincts rather than the Laws that bind them. But what is the appeal of a creed if it does not yoke all men to like behaviour?
1285: 6.669799: How strange and foolish is man. He loses his health in gaining wealth. Then, to regain health he wastes his wealth. He ruins his present while worrying about his future, but weeps in the future by recalling the past. He lives as though death shall never come to him, but dies in a way as if he were never born.
1641: 6.6663523: Is it? Tell me this, Sheriff. If your kid loves you so much, why is he leaving? You think you're special, cowboy? You're a piece of plastic. You were made to be thrown away.
1570: 6.6659293: Great learning comes from bright morality and affection for the people. To stop here is virtuous. Understanding where to stop brings stability, and with that comes peace. Peace brings with it serenity and clear thinking, with which you can achieve your goals.
828: 6.6652384: In Penny Lane, there is a barber showing photographs of every head he's had the pleasure to know. And all the people that come and go, stop and say, "Hello".
1555: 6.6641064: A young man stands in his bedroom. It just so happens that today, the 13th of April, 2009, is this young man's birthday. Though it was thirteen years ago he was given life, it is only today he will be given a name!
782: 6.66372: Manual shifters are like that. You're not simply pulling a paddle and letting the transmission do all the hard work. The gearbox never does a thing until you command it to do so; you're 100 percent in charge.
1804: 6.662524: Enjoy this next test. I'm going to go to the surface. It's a beautiful day out. Yesterday I saw a deer. If you solve this next test, maybe I'll let you ride an elevator all the way up to the break room. And I'll tell you about that time I saw a deer again.
71: 6.6590605: You're something out of a dream! Messing with my head. And I've been looking for you. Are you hiding? 'Cause I like the way you're calling to me! Your spell upon me. You're something out of a dream! And I like it, though I fight it.
1752: 6.6578555: In Haskell, lists are a homogenous data structure. It stores several elements of the same type. That means that we can have a list of integers or a list of characters but we can't have a list that has a few integers and then a few characters.
1766: 6.6572237: Lambdas are basically anonymous functions that are used because we need some functions only once. To make a lambda, we write a backslash, and then we write the parameters, separated by spaces.
1098: 6.6506414: It is the moment of non-construction, disclosing the absentation of actuality from the concept in part through its invitation to emphasize, in reading, the helplessness - rather than the will to power - of its fall into conceptuality.
1484: 6.6491637: Rapunzel, look in that mirror. You know what I see? I see a strong, confident, beautiful young lady... Oh look, you're here too!
1117: 6.6484838: Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didn't do than by the ones you did do. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover.
1693: 6.6484246: A mathematician's patterns, like the painter's or the poet's, must be beautiful; the ideas, like the colors or the words, must fit together in a harmonious way. Beauty is the first test; there is no permanent place in the world for ugly mathematics.
235: 6.6470885: There is no death, there is only the Force. There is no emotion, there is peace. There is no ignorance, there is knowledge. There is no passion, there is serenity. There is no chaos, there is harmony. There is no death, there is the Force.
1426: 6.6397805: Ooh, extra points for recycling. The girls' score is now the square root of pi while the boys still have a crudely-drawn picture of a duck. Clearly it's still anyone's game.
1707: 6.6392713: Here. It's a dreamcatcher. Wear it when you sleep, and I'll keep the nightmares away. I'll always be with you.
17: 6.635567: I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.
1428: 6.635504: So what you're saying is if I let you go, you'll tell me where my keys are? Oh, for Pete's sake, why didn't you say that like an hour ago? Oh, look, they were under your cute little platypus foot the whole time.
148: 6.6352377: You have a good many little gifts and virtues, but there is no need of parading them, for conceit spoils the finest genius. There is not much danger that real talent or goodness will be overlooked long; even if it is, the consciousness of possessing and using it well should satisfy one, and the great charm of all power is modesty.
212: 6.634877: Friendship - my definition - is built on two things. Respect and trust. Both elements have to be there. And it has to be mutual. You can have respect for someone, but if you don't have trust, the friendship will crumble.
605: 6.6345344: Books were flung aside without being put away on the shelves, inkstands were overturned, benches thrown down, and the whole school was turned loose an hour before the usual time, bursting forth like a legion of young imps, yelping and racketing about the green in joy at their early emancipation.
1893: 6.6344576: The light is in the air. I still believe cold is my way. I'll do all in my power to leave the pain just behind me, use your mind, relieve your soul. Head into the wind, cold is my way, make my mind go blank to leave regrets. Just behind me, use your mind to rise above. With all your might, use your mind and relieve your soul.
1807: 6.634098: To maintain a constant testing cycle, I simulate daylight at all hours, and add adrenal vapor to your oxygen supply. So you may be confused about the passage of time. The point is, yesterday was your birthday. I thought you'd want to know.
192: 6.633881: Today might be the chance to grasp the chance to let your talent bloom. Maybe tomorrow, the day after, or next year... Maybe even when you're thirty. I'm not sure if physique has anything to do with it, but if you think that it will never come, it probably never will.
1631: 6.6313987: Let me guess. Andy's a real special kid. And to him you're his buddy, his best friend. And when Andy plays with you it's like, even though you're not moving, you feel like you're alive. Because that's how he sees you.
2325: 6.6254125: She came in and she was like a shot of espresso. She's like being bathed in sunlight. She's incredibly energetic and enthusiastic. And she had this sense of play and fun which was incredibly exciting.
1412: 6.623629: Perry the Platypus. As usual, your timing is incredible. And by incredible, of course, I mean completely credible!
1267: 6.621443: Dear Roxanne, couldn't sleep, so I thought I'd drop you a line. My dad and I are having a great time. We're only days away from L.A., and I can hardly wait for the big concert!
1648: 6.62132: SCP-049 is a humanoid entity, roughly 1.9 meters in height, which bears the appearance of a medieval plague doctor.
1558: 6.62019: Waters of chaos have invaded all space, the flood on Earth again; I have to find the whales. That once did guide us to dry lands of life; I won't despair, I'll break this dark around. Under heavy sea, I'll search the flight of whales.
393: 6.619537: Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God. And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.
228: 6.6191034: Destiny. Fate. Dreams. These unstoppable ideas are held deep in the heart of man. As long as there are people who seek freedom in this life, these things shall not vanish from the Earth.
1818: 6.6181045: Well, no matter. Because I'm still holding all the cards. And guess what: they're all full houses! I've never actually played cards. Meaning to learn.
1504: 6.617508: Gotta fix that calendar I have that's marked July 15th. Because since there's no more you, there's no more anniversary. I'm so fed up with my thoughts of you and your memory. And how every song reminds me of what used to be.
2190: 6.617094: I waited and waited to see you all come down the sidewalk, and as I waited I thought, Atticus Finch won't win, he can't win, but he's the only man in these parts who can keep a jury out so long in a case like that. And I thought to myself, well, we're taking a step - it's just a baby-step, but it's a step.
1326: 6.6124268: So anyway, I was in line behind Big Tony, you know with the glandular problem, and he takes two puddings, two! And the guards didn't even bust him for it. I tell you, the money this prison wastes, it's criminal!
923: 6.611965: The English language can not fully capture the depth and complexity of my thoughts. So I'm incorporating Emoji into my speech to better express myself. Winky face.
1225: 6.6092153: Never was there such a send-off as that given the Sixth Massachusetts Regiment, the first to leave for Washington. Thousands saw the trains off from Boston, the cheering loud enough to stir the saints.
1598: 6.6087832: Most people only live for their image, that is why where some have a self, a starting point, most people have a void, because they are so busy projecting themselves as this or that, dedicating their lives to actualize a concept of what they should be like rather than to actualize their ever-growing potentiality as a human being.
1050: 6.6032066: The relative execution times of instructions on a machine are usually discussed in clocks rather than absolute fractions of a second; one good reason for this is that clock speeds for various models of the machine may increase as technology improves, and it is usually the relative times one is interested in when discussing the instruction set.
443: 6.602987: In intercourse with scholars and artists one readily makes mistakes of opposite kinds: in a remarkable scholar one not infrequently finds a mediocre man; and often, even in a mediocre artist, one finds a very remarkable man.
1287: 6.5945053: Names convey meanings; our choice of names determines the meaning of what we say. An inappropriate name gives people the wrong idea. A rose by any other name would smell as sweet-but if you call it a pen, people will be rather disappointed when they try to write with it.
602: 6.593393: Apparently there had been some appalling act of justice recently inflicted, for his scholars were all busily intent upon their books, or slyly whispering behind them with one eye kept upon the master; and a kind of buzzing stillness reigned throughout the schoolroom.
135: 6.592817: The world isn't fair? What a huge revelation! Some people in power abuse those they have power over? Amazing! When did this start happening?
103: 6.5886455: And as we wind on down the road, our shadows taller than our soul. There walks a lady we all know, who shines white light and wants to show how everything still turns to gold. And if you listen very hard, the tune will come to you at last. When all are one and one is all, to be a rock and not to roll. And she's buying a stairway to heaven.
2164: 6.58758: We laughed, and Morrie laughed, too, as hard as he could, with his limited breathing. It was the first time in weeks that I could recall him telling a story like this. How strange, I thought, that he nearly fainted once from watching someone else's illness, and now he was so able to endure his own.
1812: 6.5863595: Great work! Because this message is prerecorded, any observations related to your performance are speculation on our part. Please disregard any undeserved compliments.
2366: 6.5846157: Finally! I'm an adult! I can do things I was never allowed to do as a kid like eat ice cream for every meal! My brain has absorbed heaps and reams of knowledge! Like the reasons why I shouldn't eat ice cream for every meal.
1381: 6.5791497: We've frozen all of Syndrome's assets. If he even sneezes, we'll be there with a hanky and a pair of handcuffs. The people of this country are indebted to you.
2099: 6.5777726: If you're just looking for raw speed, then do all the practice that you can and analyze yourself for areas of improvement. But if you like the idea of rewiring your brain and starting from scratch, then maybe you can find yourself an alternate layout and get good with that.
48: 6.5772605: I don't know about you, but I'm feeling 22. Everything will be alright, if you keep me next to you. You don't know about me but I bet you want to. Everything will be alright, if we just keep dancing like we're 22.
526: 6.5760736: If through the advancing power of scientific methods, we find that the pursuits on which we were once engaged, afford no longer a sufficiently ample field for intellectual effort, the remedy is, to proceed to higher inquiries, and, in new tracks, to seek for difficulties yet unsubdued.
282: 6.575554: But all we said, not a word could we drag out of him; I almost felt like pushing him over, so as to change his position, for it was almost intolerable, it seemed so painfully and unnaturally constrained; especially, as in all probability he had been sitting so for upwards of eight or ten hours, going too without his regular meals.
180: 6.5735087: As you can see, I have memorized this utterly useless piece of information long enough to pass a test question. I now intend to forget it forever. You've taught me nothing except how to cynically manipulate the system. Congratulations.
1159: 6.570644: What I want is to be needed. What I need is to be indispensable to somebody. Who I need is somebody that will eat up all my free time, my ego, my attention. Somebody addicted to me. A mutual addiction.
2140: 6.569346: Never use margin to buy stock. The one time it's handy, when used responsibly, is as a convenient, low-cost way to make yourself a quick loan while you wait for your next paycheck, or your home sale to settle.
440: 6.56801: There is, in fine, a gradation of rank in physical states, to which the gradation of rank in the problems corresponds; and the highest problems repel ruthlessly every one who ventures too near them, without being predestined for their solution by the loftiness and power of his spirituality.
1419: 6.5669675: Perry the Platypus, I... You know, we always do the same thing. I have a scheme, you try to stop me, I trap you, I tell you my scheme, you escape, then we fight, and I'm defeated. Let's mix it up a little!
1556: 6.56191: I struggled to survive in the mortal world since I came to life and joined this world. I lived my own life according to my own feelings, and even if the waves toss me up and down, sending me to the border of death, I will never grieve, lament, fear, or worry; I will savor these flavors thoroughly, and will still laugh crazily until the end.
830: 6.5601363: Ultimately it's a beautiful thing. Like flowers blooming in a lonely field. The petals drift through crossing winds. They find their way to river streams, that scent the water beautifully, it takes me back to you. It takes me back to you.
1339: 6.5584908: Man, Arnold. I can't believe it. Your last day of detention, and you're completely innocent. If you finish off the day and don't snitch on those other guys, this is gonna go on your permanent record.
1176: 6.5564585: I imagine death so much it feels more like a memory. When's it gonna get me? In my sleep? Seven feet ahead of me? If I see it comin', do I run or do I let it be? Is it like a beat without a melody?
2179: 6.5548315: We do not propose to say that there shall be no rich men. We do not ask to divide the wealth. We only propose that, when one man gets more than he and his children and his children's children can spend or use in their lifetimes, that then we shall say that such person has his share. That means a few million dollars is the limit to what any one man can own.
1925: 6.5545216: We pigs are brainworkers. The whole management and organization of this farm depend on us. Day and night we are watching over your welfare. It is for your sake that we drink that milk and eat those apples.
1330: 6.5526047: Well deary, back in the day I trained the sternest nannies the world has ever seen, but times changed. A stern nanny was no longer the fashion. Fewer and fewer of my graduates were hired. Finally, nanny had to close her lovely academy for good.
1327: 6.549093: That's the downside with working with villains, they are always stealing your stuff! Oh, that reminds me, has anyone seen my stapler?
1420: 6.54309: Well, that sounds charming, boys, but I haven't played drums since the accident. Fell asleep in a metronome factory, when I awoke I completely lost my sense of rhythm. I've been hanging out here ever since.
1754: 6.5402074: Not only can we have multiple predicates in list comprehensions, we can also draw from several lists. When drawing from several lists, comprehensions produce all combinations of the given lists and then join them by the output function we supply.
1394: 6.538291: This is Stanky Dog, coming to you on the hottest day of the summer. Unless you live at the beach, I say take it easy and do nothing today. Yup, just find yourself a shady tree and maybe an aquatic mammal of some sort, and just blow the whole day off.
1038: 6.534212: All new laws, though penned with the greatest technical skill, and passed on the fullest and most mature deliberation, are considered as more or less obscure and equivocal, until their meaning be liquidated and ascertained by a series of particular discussions and adjudications.
1764: 6.5333643: If we call a function with too few parameters, we get back a partially applied function, meaning a function that takes as many parameters as we left out. Using partial application is a neat way to create functions on the fly so we can pass them to another function or to seed them with some data.
224: 6.5302176: Anne said no more until they turned into their own lane. A little gypsy wind came down it to meet them, laden with the spicy perfume of young dew-wet ferns. Far up in the shadows a cheerful light gleamed out through the trees from the kitchen at Green Gables.
255: 6.527446: It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way.
2259: 6.527144: That day, if our positions were switched... Would our fates be different? Would I have your life, and you mine? Let's settle this... Dante.
1965: 6.5254474: Napoleon decreed that there should be a full investigation into Snowball's activities. With his dogs in attendance he set out and made a careful tour of inspection of the farm buildings, the other animals following at a respectful distance.
1688: 6.5244823: Want to break into a secure facility? Walk up to the door carrying an armload of computers, parts, and dangling cords. Ask someone to hold open the door, and thank them.
173: 6.519515: I'm so glad you came, I'm so glad you remembered to see how we're ending our last dance together. Reluctantly, cautiously, but prettier than ever - I really believe that this time it's forever.
590: 6.516885: My boy died at the Wrath Gate. I am here only to collect his body. I made a promise to his mother before she died; that I would cross the Dark Portal alone - whether I lived or died, my son would be safe. Untainted...
1084: 6.5157743: This life is punctuated by some missteps, failing to glean the right emphasis and the meaning. This life is punctuated like a texting session, between two overheated, insecure teens.
1816: 6.505759: Oh, in case you got covered in that repulsion gel, here's some advice the lab boys gave me: DO NOT get covered in the repulsion gel.
1178: 6.5036817: What is done cannot be undone. I am offering you a path forward. Your discomfort is understandable. You don't feel right trading your life for another's. But know this, every one of these men and women would gladly trade their life to save yours.
1841: 6.500027: This place must once have been quite the hub, built at the border between two lands, that misty drop to one side and those bulbous growths another. Neither place seems particularly welcoming so while my little treats last, I think I'll stay right here.
1931: 6.495631: There was not an animal on the farm that did not take vengeance on them after his own fashion. Even the cat suddenly leapt off a roof onto a cowman's shoulders and sank her claws in his neck, at which he yelled horribly. At a moment when the opening was clear, the men were glad enough to rush out of the yard and make a bolt for the main road.
164: 6.494756: You have brains in your head. You have feet in your shoes. You can steer yourself any direction you choose. You're on your own. And you know what you know. And YOU are the one who'll decide where to go...
2067: 6.49106: It is said that in breathing, man recapitulates the rhythm of the universe. When the mind is fastened to the rhythm of breathing, it tends to become absorbed and calm. Whether on or off the court, I know of no better way to begin to deal with anxiety than to place the mind on one's breathing process.
1715: 6.4905925: Wagon of governance that drives the world with wheel and axle joined together, will have a smooth path without obstacles if wagoner is skillful; if he's inept in driving, it will get mired in slush of enmity daily, bringing more and more misery.
1449: 6.4873123: Hey, listen. You don't look so hot either, kid. Most superheroes don't wear their own merch.
1202: 6.48534: Everybody knows that pestilences have a way of recurring in the world; yet somehow we find it hard to believe in ones that crash down on our heads from a blue sky. There have been as many plagues as wars in history; yet always plagues and wars take people equally by surprise.
1798: 6.4851465: Most test subjects do experience some cognitive deterioration after a few months in suspension. Now you've been under for... quite a lot longer, and it's not out of the question that you might have a very minor case of serious brain damage.
1062: 6.4828267: When he got home, he made room on his personal nightmare, his desk, for the flatbed scanner, then played with it for several hours, learning how to scan an image at the right sensitivity, the correct brightness and reflectivity for the proper resolution.
569: 6.4819055: Such things naturally left on the surface, for the time, a chill which we vociferously denied that we felt; and we had, all three, with repetition, got into such splendid training that we went, each time, almost automatically, to mark the close of the incident, through the very same movements.
2343: 6.47311: The flame flew forward and illuminated the interior. The passageway seemed to go on forever. Soon enough, the flame lost its forward momentum, fell to the ground and smouldered for a bit before flickering out of existence.
415: 6.472065: Oh, these aren't homemade. They were made in a factory... a bomb factory. They're bombs.
1717: 6.4702315: In this world, wherever there is light - there are also shadows. As long as the concept of winners exists, there must also be losers. The selfish desire of wanting to maintain peace causes wars, and hatred is born to protect love.
1849: 6.4702315: In this world, wherever there is light - there are also shadows. As long as the concept of winners exists, there must also be losers. The selfish desire of wanting to maintain peace causes wars, and hatred is born to protect love.
1132: 6.4678698: Overcame all the fight, never lose fate and destiny. With my soul, with my sword. I will fight, I won't ever lose. All the blood, all the lives. Never lose fate and destiny. With the sorrow, with my grief, now I stand right before you!
407: 6.4677305: Mr. Putnam, I have here an accusation by Mr. Corey against you. He states that you coldly prompted your daughter to cry witchery upon George Jacobs that is now in jail.
2138: 6.465678: He'll give you advice on October broilers or the frost in Florida... gladly. What he won't tell you - or it will cost him dearly if it does - is that you shouldn't be in the game at all.
2119: 6.463744: She taught me my scales and exercises, too, on the little parlor organ which her husband had bought her after fifteen years, during which she had not so much as seen any instrument except an accordion, that belonged to one of the Norwegian farm-hands.
1663: 6.4597306: Now we are completely invincible. We are united, power, force of courage. We'll fight just for reality of this world. We never give up and surely raise our swords. Force of courage!
1905: 6.4535136: And remember, comrades, your resolution must never falter. No argument must lead you astray. Never listen when they tell you that Man and the animals have a common interest, that the prosperity of the one is the prosperity of the others. It is all lies.
927: 6.45203: Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me. I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed. She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb in the shape of an "L" on her forehead.
1048: 6.4512906: Whenever that look appeared in her wild, bright, deeply black eyes, it invested her with a strange remoteness and intangibility: it was as if she were hovering in the air, and might vanish, like a glimmering light that comes we know not whence and goes we know not whither.
618: 6.4480658: The result was twofold: the first and most obvious being a sore back for the horses, and the second being that the horses became so accustomed to a continual tattoo to encourage them to improve their pace, that, with a rider unaccustomed to that method, they lagged most annoyingly.
2222: 6.4472203: I have been living in this country nine years longer than you have. Do you realize that? Yet I am prevented by law from becoming a citizen. I am prevented by law from owning land. I am now separated from my family without cause...
12: 6.4471025: At first glance, this plant resembles the spring used in the ship's sub-light engine. Many of its most primitive characteristics remain intact, including its habit of spreading through the dispersal of spores.
1059: 6.444813: The sublime, light blue walls and specially fitted blue tint light bulbs added a calming influence to the constant urgency that drove the computer operators who pushed buttons, changed tapes and stared at the dozens of amber screens on the computers.
1167: 6.4435806: Existence was bigger than just life. It was everyone's life all together, and even if you lived in Buffalo, New York and had never been more than ten miles from home, you were part of the puzzle, too. It didn't matter how small your life was.
1785: 6.441912: The bean counters told me we literally could not afford to buy seven dollars' worth of moon rocks, much less seventy million. Bought 'em anyway. Ground 'em up, mixed 'em into a gel.
1046: 6.437107: So strangely did they meet in the dim wood that it was like the first encounter in the world beyond the grave of two spirits who had been intimately connected in their former life, but now stood coldly shuddering in mutual dread, as not yet familiar with their state, nor wonted to the companionship of disembodied beings.
270: 6.4347696: And in the darkness, in the secret hour, when we awoke in the night and there were no brothers around us, but only their shapes in the beds and their snores, we closed our eyes, and we held our lips shut, and we stopped our breath, that no shudder might let our brothers see or hear or guess, and we thought that we wished to be sent to the Home of the Scholars when our time would come.
1857: 6.431394: The Babel fish is small, yellow and leech-like, and probably the oddest thing in the Universe. It feeds on brainwave energy received not from its own carrier but from those around it.
1332: 6.4307656: Yeah, you know how it is when you lose one of your senses. The others just kind of kick into overdrive. Speaking of which, you might want to try a stronger deodorant, football-head.
1686: 6.4287395: Visceral design is what nature does. We humans evolved to coexist in the environment of other humans, animals, plants, landscapes, weather, and other natural phenomena.
1180: 6.4243174: Greetings, fellow humans! Human fellas! I sure do like hanging out with other humans, and talking about things like money... and starting wars!
1328: 6.415032: I'm guessing Bueno Nacho, movie, 3 hours of you trying to win a stuffed frog from the claw machine at the Middleton Mall.
2228: 6.4143558: He brought back chunks of driftwood, and he would pass long hours sitting on the steps carving myrtle limbs into benches, table legs, and lamps, filling our rooms with bits of gnarled, polished furniture.
179: 6.412081: Everybody seeks happiness! Not me, though! That's the difference between me and the rest of the world. Happiness isn't good enough for me! I demand euphoria!
2250: 6.411599: So let us begin anew - remembering on both sides that civility is not a sign of weakness, and sincerity is always subject to proof. Let us never negotiate out of fear. But let us never fear to negotiate.
1036: 6.408434: The creation of crimes after the commission of the fact, or, in other words, the subjecting of men to punishment for things which, when they were done, were breaches of no law, and the practice of arbitrary imprisonments, have been, in all ages, the favorite and most formidable instruments of tyranny.
252: 6.4068704: Mankind is the animal that makes tools. In each generation, only a few people get a chance to create new tools. Very, very few get to contribute to making a tool that changes the lives of first hundreds, then thousands, then tens of thousands, and someday millions of people.
1056: 6.405797: Anna often demanded unreasonable service from her older brothers; that they should sit up until after midnight to bring her home from parties when she did not like the youth who had offered himself as her escort; or that they should drive twelve miles into the country, on a winter night, to take her to a ranch dance, after they had been working hard all day.
1629: 6.404984: You're in direct violation of code 6404.5. Stating all space rangers are to be in hyper-sleep until awakened by authorized personnel.
2316: 6.401843: Recall is retrieving information that is not currently in your conscious awareness but that was learned at an earlier time. A fill-in-the-blank question tests your recall.
1286: 6.401774: If nature has made you for a giver, your hands are born open, and so is your heart; and though there may be times when your hands are empty, your heart is always full, and you give things out of that - warm things, kind things, sweet things - help and comfort and laughter - and sometimes gay, kind laughter is the best help of all.
2061: 6.3989506: Smile for the camera 'cause the world's on fire. Cheers to the moment when the worlds rip off; I'll be holding on with you. Dance with the devil in the pouring rain; sharks in the water but it's all the same. I'll be holding on; I'll be holding on with you.
2246: 6.3986263: A gust of wind rushed through the orchard, bringing ice off the white slopes, and more blossom scent. It hurt to inhale deeply. I pulled my coat tight, ready to head for the car's warmth, but also wanting to hold this moment for a little longer. I might never be back here again.
1777: 6.3979726: Well done. Here come the test results: You are a horrible person. I'm serious, that's what it says: A horrible person. We weren't even testing for that.
962: 6.3966856: Every day I'm here, I think: Why did it ever come to this? Damaged minds and bodies, their freedom taken away. Even losing themselves. If people knew it would come to this, nobody would go to war.
1280: 6.3955536: All teenagers are hackers. They have to be, if only because their life circumstances are untenable. They think they're adults, but the adults think they're kids.
1560: 6.391365: Destiny has cheated me by forcing me to decide upon, the woman that I idolize, or the hands of an automaton. Without these hands I can't complete the opera that was captivating her, but if I keep them, and she marries him, then he probably won't want me dating her.
1120: 6.3882394: I am nothing special, of this I am sure. I am a common man with common thoughts and I've led a common life. There are no monuments dedicated to me and my name will soon be forgotten, but I've loved another with all my heart and soul, and to me, this has always been enough...
913: 6.3876567: I don't wanna see you cry. You don't have to feel this emptiness. She said I love you till the day that I die. Well maybe she's right 'cause I don't wanna feel like I'm not me. And to be honest I don't even know why I let myself get down in the first place.
2028: 6.387248: The sea is emotion incarnate. It loves, hates, and weeps. It defies all attempts to capture it with words and rejects all shackles. No matter what you say about it, there is always that which you can't.
1057: 6.3764443: Although this process has met with opposition from some of the editors on the grounds that imperfect work may leave their offices, the advantages in making this material available as a research tool outweigh fears about the misspelling of proper names and other relatively minor editorial matters.
2328: 6.374641: Maybe there are people who can achieve incredible success overnight but I don't know any of them. It is a gradual evolution, a long series of small wins and tiny breakthroughs. The only way we make progress is to start small.
1987: 6.3716955: Two of the men had produced a crowbar and a sledge hammer. They were going to knock the windmill down. 'Impossible!' cried Napoleon.
1039: 6.3711014: If a pertinacious minority can control the opinion of a majority, respecting the best mode of conducting it, the majority, in order that something may be done, must conform to the views of the minority; and thus the sense of the smaller number will overrule that of the greater, and give a tone to the national proceedings.
1906: 6.37034: Man serves the interests of no creature except himself. And among us animals let there be perfect unity, perfect comradeship in the struggle. All men are enemies. All enemies are comrades.
1915: 6.370202: For the first few minutes the animals could hardly believe in their good fortune. The first act was to gallop in a body right around the boundaries of the farm, as though to make quite sure that no human being was hiding anywhere upon it; then they raced back to the farm buildings to wipe out the last traces of Jones' hated reign.
1627: 6.3696847: Alright, come here. Come on. Let me see that. Oh, it's just a popped seam. Easily repaired. You should consider yourself lucky.
1821: 6.36935: You know what I have too many of around here? Monitors. I was just thinking earlier today I wish I had fewer monitors that were working. So you're actually helping me by smashing them.
1719: 6.3675847: Compromise where you can. Where you can't, don't. Even if everyone is telling you that something wrong is something right. Even if the whole world is telling you to move, it is your duty to plant yourself like a tree, look them in the eye, and say: No, you move.
938: 6.3674903: Whatever made me the way I am left me hollow, empty inside, unable to feel. It doesn't seem like a big deal. I'm quite sure most people fake an awful lot of everyday human contact. I just fake it all. I fake it very well, and the feelings are never there.
915: 6.36736: Fear is a strange soil. It grows obedience like corn, which grow in straight lines to make weeding easier. But sometimes it grows the potatoes of defiance, which flourish underground.
400: 6.36566: Do you smell it? That smell. A kind of smelly smell. The smelly smell that smells... smelly.
1561: 6.364997: I've modded the device to release a single huge antichroniton blast. It should rip us out of stasis back to the instant before I conceived of the Time Button.
446: 6.3621755: Cynicism is the only form in which base souls approach what is called honesty; and the higher man must open his ears to all the coarser or finer cynicism, and congratulate himself when the clown becomes shameless right before him, or the scientific satyr speaks out.
1023: 6.3609266: You stress over money and your career, you set your clocks back, you exercise, you wait in line, you paint your house, get depressed, feel better, buy things, take your clothes to the dry cleaner, set your clocks forward and spend your whole life waiting for happiness to arrive in the mail.
726: 6.357531: After so much careful work, it does seem as if not one pen out of a thousand could be faulty; but every one has to be carefully examined to make sure that the cutting, piercing, marking, forming, tempering, grinding, and slitting, are just what they should be.
7: 6.357461: If I disobey that fat old fool K. Rool, it's the big sawmill in the sky for me, so pay up pronto and I can get my wooden butt outta here!
1049: 6.357294: I have often felt that programming is an art form, whose real value can only be appreciated by another versed in the same arcane art; there are lovely gems and brilliant coups hidden from human view and admiration, sometimes forever, by the very nature of the process.
1464: 6.3535156: I was lucky enough to have a friend. A friend who dragged me out of the darkness and showed me I was wrong. He put every emotion he had right into his Beyblade, and he used every bit of that strength to show me exactly what true strength was, and true resonance.
1471: 6.350759: If you leave your game, stay safe, stay alert, and whatever you do, don't die! Because if you die outside your own game, you don't regenerate, ever! Game over.
2003: 6.3498354: They accepted everything that they were told about the Rebellion and the principles of Animalism, especially from Clover, for whom they had an almost filial respect; but it was doubtful whether they understood much of it.
139: 6.347167: You don't cry when someone pushes you down. You get up. You get up and you fight back. And pretty soon nobody's going to shove you anymore because they'll see it's not worth it.
1423: 6.3461676: Perry the Platypus! Oh, your persistence is insufferable. And by that, I mean completely sufferable.
1055: 6.3453164: Many introverted hackers who are next to inarticulate in person communicate with considerable fluency over the net, perhaps precisely because they can forget on an unconscious level that they are dealing with people and thus don't feel stressed and anxious as they would face to face.
156: 6.342287: It bothered him a little to lie about small things. But he always had; he had grown up lying, and he still found it strange that the people in this place where he now lived thought lying was wrong. To Matty, it was sometimes a way of making things easier, more comfortable, more convenient.
523: 6.3387585: Being kept awake one night by a toothache, some thoughts undesignedly came into his head concerning the roulette or cycloid; one idea followed another; and he thus discovered properties of this curve even to demonstration.
1797: 6.3380175: You should now feel mentally reinvigorated. If you suspect staring at art has not provided the required intellectual sustenance, reflect briefly on this classical music.
2091: 6.337482: Overwriting the habits and techniques that I use to type each word is actually pretty mentally taxing: suddenly, you have to think about every single key that you press and resist your muscle memory's inclination to hit a different key.
1960: 6.316182: We will teach this miserable traitor that he cannot undo our work so easily. Remember comrades, there must be no alteration in our plans: they shall be carried out to the day. Forward, comrades!
1322: 6.313706: I know I'm going to regret saying this, but you may have finally achieved "so dumb it just might work."
485: 6.3136973: With a single keystroke, the typewriter was capable of automatically backspacing and then overstriking the previous characters with minimal marring of the paper.
1685: 6.3124056: This clearly went too far, since most disputes are not about points of logic but about points of fact, and anyway not even all logical truths can be proved mathematically in the way Leibniz envisaged.
2376: 6.3110256: I hate being clever, thought the captain, when you don't really feel clever and don't want to be clever. To sneak around and make plans and feel big about making them. I hate this feeling of thinking I'm doing right when I'm not really certain I am.
158: 6.309159: Perhaps simple to be known, to be looked upon by so many people, to be the focal point of so many concentrating eyes, perhaps this was enough to make one different; enough to transform one into something else, someone else; just as by becoming an increasingly larger boy one became one day a man.
149: 6.306979: Some things you just can't explain. You don't even try. You don't know where to start. All your sentences would jumble up like a giant knot if you opened your mouth. Any words you used would come out wrong.
1165: 6.3056726: It's a rare day when she speaks in anything but platitudes - all those exhausted phrases and hand-me-down ideas that cram the dump sites of contemporary wisdom.
1063: 6.3049273: Whether that data is raw in nature, such as names, addresses and phone numbers, or it consists of secret governmental strategies and policies or proprietary business details, information is the key building block upon which modern society functions.
1916: 6.2978907: Then they made a tour of inspection of the whole farm and surveyed with speechless admiration the ploughland, the hayfield, the orchard, the pool, the spinney. It was as though they had never seen these things before, and even now they could hardly believe that it was all their own.
1639: 6.296975: You shouldn't have come back, cowboy. They've cracked down hard since you left. More guards, more patrols. You and your friends ain't ever getting out of here now.
540: 6.2954736: Thus the law of what logicians term simple conversion, is determined by the fact, that the corresponding equations are symmetrical, that they are unaffected by a mutual change of place, in those symbols which correspond to the convertible classes.
1475: 6.2918897: But do not name it, my friend, for it is like water. Nothing is softer than water, yet it can overcome rock. It does not fight. It flows around the opponent, formless, nameless.
2059: 6.2906404: Free to elect who we want. Free to live how we want, and most importantly, free to go wherever we want without the confine of those huge black walls. So with that in mind, I would like to thank everyone for coming to this wonderful event. Let the festival begin.
388: 6.290473: You can't write a story until you've felt it. Breathed it in. Walked with your characters. Talked with them. That's why you've come here. To live your story.
1640: 6.2826643: You can unlock doors, sneak past guards, climb the wall, but if you don't take out that monkey, you ain't going nowhere. You wanna get out of here? Get rid of that monkey!
2347: 6.2778053: There must've been some sort of mechanism installed on the heavy-looking door, since the physical strength of a 67-year-old man was enough to easily open it.
1234: 6.2773514: Research shows that there is only half as much variation in student achievement between schools as there is among classrooms in the same school. If you want your child to get the best education possible, it is actually more important to get him assigned to a great teacher than to a great school.
2330: 6.277053: It is so easy to overestimate the importance of one defining moment and underestimate the value of making small improvements on a daily basis. Too often, we convince ourselves that massive success requires massive action but it's simply not true.
1709: 6.276216: If a physician of high standing, and one's own husband, assures friends and relatives that there is really nothing the matter with one but temporary nervous depression - a slight hysterical tendency - what is one to do?
417: 6.27603: My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all. The morning rain clouds up my window, and I can't see at all. And even if I could it'll all be gray, but your picture on my wall. It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad.
1936: 6.274102: A thought struck Clover. Without saying anything to the others she went to Mollie's stall and turned over the straw with her hoof. Hidden under the straw was a little pile of lump sugar and several bunches of ribbon of different colours.
1683: 6.2712526: The trial of Socrates took place in 399 BC when he was nearly seventy. The charges were that he refused to recognize the official gods of the state, that he introduced new gods and that he corrupted the young.
788: 6.2684: Some old people keep young at heart in spite of wrinkles and gray hairs, can sympathize with children's little cares and joys, make them feel at home, and can hide wise lessons under pleasant plays, giving and receiving friendship in the sweetest way.
61: 6.263682: You're so afraid of losing the people that you love that you push them away. And that's why you'll always be an orphan. You don't need some villain swooping in to destroy your happiness. You do that quite well all on your own.
1727: 6.260454: Everything we're putting in that box comes ungrounded. And I don't mean grounded to the earth, I mean not tethered. We're blocking whatever keeps it moving forward, so they flip-flop.
1053: 6.25999: Since users always want to be able to do everything but never want to suffer for any mistakes, the construction of a firewall is a question not only of defensive coding but also of interface presentation, so that users don't even get curious about those corners of a system where they can burn themselves.
922: 6.2591133: You're just too good to be true, can't take my eyes off of you. You'll be like heaven to touch, I wanna hold you so much. At long last, love has arrived and I thank God, I'm alive. You're just too good to be true, can't take my eyes off of you.
1996: 6.258811: The animals sniffed the air hungrily and wondered whether a warm mash was being prepared for their supper. But no warm mash appeared, and on the following Sunday it was announced that from onwards all barley would be reserved for the pigs.
2389: 6.2584243: I need you more than you know, more than you'd believe. You're the only thing that really makes me want to live. There are times when I feel like I have no will to fight. You always come and chase the demons from my mind. You're beautiful inside and out, and I wish to thank you, for you're the one who made me want to stay.
1377: 6.252763: What do you think is going on here? You think we're on vacation or something? Mom and Dad's lives could be in jeopardy. Or worse, their marriage.
2346: 6.2513413: Treasures or rare loot found in a dungeon would normally be divided equally among all the participants in a raid. It was quite a different way of sharing the rewards where one could take possession of magic crystals one procured by themselves.
1694: 6.2513213: Listen to me, mister. You're my knight in shining armor. Don't you forget it. You're going to get back on that horse, and I'm going to be right behind you, holding on tight, and away we're gonna go, go, go!
118: 6.24731: Our purpose on this earth is not one single event, an accomplishment we can check off a list. There is no test. No passing or failing. There's only us, each moment shaping who we are, into what we will become.
814: 6.247163: For quick development is of the utmost importance, and he who succeeds first in placing all his pieces, from their initial awkward positions, to such places as give them command of the greatest possible number of squares, has the better chance of concentrating a superior force on some important point.
1454: 6.2464314: Yeah, I got plenty. Disinfect the mask. You're going to want to use baby powder in the suit, heavy on the joints. You don't want any chafing, right?
410: 6.2447724: The last big rains of the year were falling. It was the time for treading red earth with which to build walls. It was not done earlier because the rains were too heavy and would have washed away the heap of trodden earth; and it could not be done later because harvesting would soon set in, and after that the dry season.
1064: 6.2434373: Many knights, who had not sufficient confidence in their own skill to defy a single adversary of high reputation, were, nevertheless, desirous of displaying their valour in the general combat, where they might meet others with whom they were more upon an equality.
1185: 6.23732: Limitations foster creativity. Tell an artist to paint anything, and he may struggle, but tell him to create something specific, in a set amount of time, for a certain audience, and these constraints might well push him to produce something he might never have come up with on his own.
1952: 6.2356153: From now onwards Animal Farm would engage in trade with the neighbouring farms: not, of course, for any commercial purpose but simply in order to obtain certain materials which were urgently necessary.
1243: 6.227592: It's a piece of cake to bake a pretty cake, if the way is hazy. You gotta do the cooking by the book, you know you can't be lazy! Never use a messy recipe, the cake will end up crazy. If you do the cooking by the book, then you'll have a cake!
476: 6.2255487: There were minor variations from one manufacturer to another, but most typewriters followed the concept that each key was attached to a typebar that had the corresponding letter molded, in reverse, into its striking head.
1955: 6.2249765: They would meet in the public houses to prove to one another by means of diagrams that the windmill was bound to fall down, or that if it did stand up, then that it would never work. And yet, against their will, they had developed a certain respect for the efficiency with which the animals were managing their own affairs.
2340: 6.2220626: His wife was deeply worried about him since this would be his first raid in quite a while. Honestly, even he himself was worried, too. However, now that he listened to Kim's words, he felt like a weight was lifted off his mind.
204: 6.222016: If it was an average pitcher, he would have given up long before, even so he wasn't bothered by his team's errors, continued to carry his team with relentless pitching. On his back... I feel like I saw a true ace.
1033: 6.221884: Of course, as we have seen, he was quite a simple man; indeed he might have passed for a boy again if he had been able to take his baldness off; but he had also a noble sense of justice and a lion's courage to do what seemed right to him; and having thought the matter out with anxious care after the flight of the children, he went down on all fours and crawled into the kennel.
1964: 6.219826: Every night, it was said, he came creeping in under cover of darkness and performed all kinds of mischief. He stored the corn, he upset the milk-pails, he broke the eggs, he tramped the seed-beds, he gnawed the bark off the fruit trees.
125: 6.2147064: True beauty is what lies inside of us, not what the world sees. A beautiful shell that houses a vile soul becomes sullied over time. But an outer shell, imperfect as it may be, that houses a beautiful soul shines with that beauty, radiating it for all who have eyes to see.
1745: 6.210178: The chain running through the locks sounded like the anchor of a galleon, and the door opened. Their pitiless guardian, the only creature who seemed alive in the instantaneous silence, began walking from one end of the dormitory to the other.
372: 6.208708: As if it were possible in these days for a young and hitherto unemployed architect suddenly to surround himself with wondrous carpets, and gold vessels, and gigantic jewels without attracting the notice of some enterprising journalist.
1360: 6.206168: This is because I don't have powers, isn't it? Well not every superhero has powers, you know. You can be super without them. I invented these. I can fly. Can you fly?
1238: 6.202362: Where the tree leaves dance, one shall find flames. The fire's shadow will illuminate the village... And once again tree leaves shall bud anew.
34: 6.2022605: On Hard, the towers cost more than normal, the bloons move faster, and you have 100 lives. Winning the Hard difficulty awards you a gold medal for that track.
1392: 6.2018547: The world is like a ride in an amusement park, and when you choose to go on it you think it's real because that's how powerful our minds are. The ride goes up and down, around and around, it has thrills and chills, and it's very brightly colored, and it's very loud, and it's fun for a while.
2364: 6.20052: Sweetie, there's no monster in your closet! Look, it's just your clothes and toys. Make sure you stay tucked in bed. It could be anywhere by now.
1421: 6.2002053: Guys come and look at this! This is an actual replica of an artist's interpretation of what some random guy of no significance believed that the chariot of Asparagus might have looked like.
931: 6.1996336: Any attempt at recovering the bodies was absolutely hopeless, and there, deep down in that dreadful cauldron of swirling water and seething foam, will lie for all time the most dangerous criminal and the foremost champion of the law of their generation.
1032: 6.1950374: He had hoped to fly, keeping not far from the ground so that nothing unwonted should escape his eyes; but in that fitful light to have flown low would have meant trailing his shadow through the trees, thus disturbing birds and acquainting a watchful foe that he was astir.
2249: 6.194999: Let both sides seek to invoke the wonders of science instead of its terrors. Together let us explore the stars, conquer the deserts, eradicate disease, tap the ocean depths and encourage the arts and commerce.
335: 6.19288: He was a killer, a thing that preyed, living on the things that lived, unaided, alone, by virtue of his own strength and prowess, surviving triumphantly in a hostile environment where only the strong survived.
1455: 6.1921115: If you stay in this dimension too long, your body's going to disintegrate. Do you know how painful that would be, Peter Parker?
1314: 6.1910486: Every last one of them. We've implemented a double-negative cover story. We make sure only to leak out information that is one-hundred percent accurate.
1224: 6.1904283: A king must live a life more vivid than any other and be figure for all to admire! The king is the one who collects the envy of all his heroes and stands as their guide! Therefore, the king is not alone! For his will equals that of all his followers combined!
594: 6.1858315: The scholars were hurried through their lessons without stopping at trifles; those who were nimble skipped over half with impunity, and those who were tardy had a smart application now and then in the rear, to quicken their speed or help them over a tall word.
1643: 6.1792035: Anyone concur with Ken? I didn't throw you away. Your kid did. Ain't one kid ever loved a toy, really. Chew on that when you're at the dump.
2342: 6.177863: The interior of the hidden, cave-like passage was dark and nothing could be seen. Mister Song activated his specialty, flame magic, and tossed it further forward into the passage.
263: 6.177532: You now walk upon the hallowed ground of the Scourge, the Light won't protect you here, Paladin. Nothing will protect you...
1651: 6.17503: I used to be frightened of dying. I used to think death was the end. But that was before, I'm not scared anymore. I know that my soul will transcend. I may never find all the answers. I may never understand why. I may never prove what I know to be true. But I know that I still have to try.
1802: 6.172783: Did you guess sharks? Because that's wrong. The correct answer is nobody. Nobody but you is that pointlessly cruel.
1966: 6.1700063: The animals were thoroughly frightened. It seemed to them as though Snowball were some kind of invisible influence, pervading the air about them and menacing them with all kinds of dangers.
1824: 6.1696324: Excellent. Although great science is always the result of collaboration, keep in mind that, like Albert Einstein and his cousin Terry, history will only remember one of you.
120: 6.1689663: Ever had a flying burrito hit you? Well, it's a deadly projectile, right up there with cannonballs and grenades.
484: 6.168867: For devices utilizing replaceable components, such as a typeball element, any association may be restricted to a specific element, rather than to the typewriter as a whole.
1144: 6.168658: I think that if I ever have kids, and they are upset, I won't tell them that people are starving in China or anything like that because it wouldn't change the fact that they were upset. And even if somebody else has it much worse, that doesn't really change the fact that you have what you have.
64: 6.1652994: Well, crying isn't gonna bring him back, unless your tears smell like dog food. So you can either sit there crying and eating can after can of dog food until your tears smell enough like dog food to make your dog come back, or you can go out there and find your dog.
147: 6.159855: I don't pretend to be wise, but I am observing, and I see a great deal more than you'd imagine. I'm interested in other people's experiences and inconsistencies, and, though I can't explain, I remember and use them for my own benefit.
1244: 6.157104: You don't know me son! You don't know me son! You don't know me son! You don't know me son! Who's going to carry the boats and the logs? Who's going to carry the boats?
1771: 6.1567073: In an imperative language, you have no guarantee that a simple function that should just crunch some numbers won't burn down your house, kidnap your dog and scratch your car with a potato while crunching those numbers.
1605: 6.154437: But one day, someone will journey beyond our reef, find Maui, deliver him across the great ocean to restore the heart of Te Fiti. I was there that day. The ocean chose you.
600: 6.153987: No signs of life occurred near him, but occasionally the melancholy chirp of a cricket, or perhaps the guttural twang of a bullfrog from a neighboring marsh, as if sleeping uncomfortably and turning suddenly in his bed.
1043: 6.1524396: We learn that it is not the rays which bodies absorb, but those which they reject, that give them the colours they are known by; and in the same way people are specialized by their dislikes and antagonisms, whilst their goodwill is looked upon as no attribute at all.
900: 6.1485977: Mr. Sun came up and he smiled at me. Said it's gonna be a good one just wait and see. Jumped out of bed, and I ran outside feeling so extra ecstatified. It's the best day ever.
1041: 6.1484528: Marie sat sewing or crocheting and tried to take a friendly interest in the game, but she was always thinking about the wide fields outside, where the snow was drifting over the fences; and about the orchard, where the snow was falling and packing, crust over crust.
254: 6.147744: Congratulations. The fact that you're reading this means you've taken one giant step closer to surviving till your next birthday. Yes, you.
1814: 6.146189: Now, maybe you don't have any tumors. Well, don't worry. If you sat on a folding chair in the lobby and weren't wearing lead underpants, we took care of that too.
1724: 6.1460066: You want to put my camcorder... inside the box that's so dangerous we can't look into it. If something happens, would you pay me back?
1517: 6.1437984: No, it tells us that you do not offer direction, suggestion, or commentary. And you should be thankful that me and Ryan are here to lift your music out of its current obscurity. Are we clear?
1774: 6.143251: A monoid is when you have an associative binary function and a value which acts as an identity with respect to that function. When something acts as an identity with respect to a function, it means that when called with that function and some other value, the result is always equal to that other value.
1494: 6.1428266: Okay, gentlemen, thanks to your new friend Ping, you'll spend tonight picking up every single grain of rice. Tomorrow, the real work begins.
1801: 6.142681: I know things look bleak, but that crazy man down there was right. Let's not take these lemons! We are going to march right back upstairs and MAKE him put me back in my body!
1844: 6.1407266: You might hear some ugly talk about it at school, but do one thing for me if you will: you just hold your head high and keep those fists down. No matter what anybody says to you, don't you let 'em get your goat. Try fighting with your head for a change.
1575: 6.1389217: You're a slacker. You say you want things but you're never willing to work for it! You never make the sacrifice. You think you're just gonna charm your way through; just like your father!
128: 6.1389165: People, I have discovered, are layers and layers of secrets. You believe you know them, that you understand them, but their motives are always hidden from you, buried in their own hearts. You will never know them, but sometimes you decide to trust them.
956: 6.1366143: It fills me with revulsion I normally hold for plague vermin, or a beached whale, stuffed with expired mayonnaise left to rot in the scorching sun of a dying planet.
220: 6.136458: You, me, or nobody is gonna hit as hard as life. But it ain't about how hard ya hit. It's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward. How much you can take and keep moving forward.
2120: 6.13628: She sat looking about with her eyes as impersonal, almost as stony, as those with which the granite Rameses in a museum watches the froth that ebbs and glows about his pedestal, separated from it by the lonely stretch of centuries.
1112: 6.1353316: Owners of dogs will have noticed that, if you provide them with food and water and shelter and affection, they will think you are god.
